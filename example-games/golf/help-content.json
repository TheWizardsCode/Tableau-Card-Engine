The drawn card appears next to the discard pile.\n\n2. Act -- choose one of two actions:\n   a) Swap: click any card in your grid to replace it with the drawn card. The replaced card goes to the discard pile.\n   b) Discard & flip: click the discard pile to throw away the drawn card, then click a face-down grid card to flip it face-up in place."
