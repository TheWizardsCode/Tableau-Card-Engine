{"data":{"assignee":"Map","createdAt":"2026-02-18T18:47:10.416Z","createdBy":"","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","dependencies":[{"from":"CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB","to":"CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH"}],"description":"# Intake Brief: 9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)\n\n**Priority: Critical** | **Type: Feature (Epic)** | **Assignee: Map**\n\n> First engine spike: build a playable single-round 9-Card Golf game (human vs. AI) to validate the Tableau Card Engine architecture end-to-end and surface missing abstractions before tackling larger games.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe Tableau Card Engine has a working scaffold (toolchain, project structure, Phaser integration) but zero game logic, card abstractions, or gameplay features. A small, well-scoped spike is needed to validate the engine architecture end-to-end — from card data models through game rules to a playable Phaser UI — and to surface missing framework capabilities before tackling larger games. 9-Card Golf's tiny rule set (flip, swap, discard on a 3x3 grid) makes it the ideal first spike.\n\n## Users\n\n- **Engine developer (primary):** Validates that the engine's modular architecture (card-system, rule-engine, core-engine, ui) can support a real game. Uses the spike to discover which abstractions are missing and which APIs need refinement.\n  - *\"As an engine developer, I want to build a complete card game using the engine modules so I can identify gaps in Card, Deck, Pile, and Grid abstractions before building more complex games.\"*\n\n- **QA / AI tester:** Uses an AI player to exercise all game paths (random + greedy strategies) and produce reproducible game transcripts for regression testing.\n  - *\"As a tester, I want an AI opponent that can play complete games automatically so I can validate scoring, turn flow, and edge cases without manual play.\"*\n\n- **Game designer (future):** Uses the completed spike as a reference implementation and template for building additional example games.\n  - *\"As a game designer, I want a working reference game that demonstrates how to wire up scenes, rules, and UI so I can quickly scaffold new card games.\"*\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. **Playable single round:** A human player can play a complete single round of 9-Card Golf against 1 AI opponent in a Phaser scene — including initial card reveal, draw/swap/discard turns, and end-of-round scoring.\n2. **AI player with two strategies:** An AI player is implemented with both random (valid moves) and greedy (minimize visible score) strategies, selectable at game start or via configuration.\n3. **Correct scoring:** Scoring logic correctly implements: A=1, 2=-2, 3-10=face value, J/Q=10, K=0, three-of-a-kind columns=0. Automated unit tests cover at least 3 distinct scoring scenarios (including a column-of-three-of-a-kind case).\n4. **Game transcript:** Each completed game produces a JSON transcript recording the full sequence of turns, actions, and resulting board states — sufficient to replay and verify the game.\n5. **Visual replay (stretch goal):** A visual replay capability captures a screenshot or canvas snapshot per turn for human review of completed games. This is a stretch goal for this spike — a dedicated dev tool for game log playback and screenshot capture will be tracked separately.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **First spike — no existing game logic:** All four engine modules (card-system, core-engine, rule-engine, ui) are currently empty stubs (version constants only). Every game-related abstraction must be built from scratch during this spike.\n- **Card assets incomplete:** Only 2 placeholder SVGs exist (ace_of_spades.svg, card_back.svg at 140x190px). A full 52-card deck of face assets is needed. Assets must be CC0 or permissively licensed (MIT, Apache 2.0, or similar) per project policy.\n- **No assumptions about framework features:** This is the project's first game spike. Do not assume any framework features exist beyond the proven scaffold (Vite, TypeScript, Phaser, Vitest). Missing capabilities must be built or sourced as part of the spike.\n- **Single round only:** Scope is limited to one round of play (one deal through to scoring). Multi-round / \"9 holes\" format is out of scope.\n- **1 Human + 1 AI:** Player count is fixed at one human and one AI opponent for this spike.\n- **Licensing:** All assets and code must be open and freely available for commercial use per CREDITS.md policy.\n\n## Existing State\n\n- **Toolchain:** Fully operational — Vite 6.1, TypeScript 5.7 (strict mode), Vitest 3.0, Phaser 3.90.0. Dev server on port 3000, production builds to `dist/`.\n- **Project structure:** Monorepo layout with `src/` (engine modules) and `example-games/` (game spikes). Path aliases configured (`@core-engine/*`, `@card-system/*`, `@rule-engine/*`, `@ui/*`).\n- **Engine modules:** All four modules (`card-system`, `core-engine`, `rule-engine`, `ui`) exist as directories with barrel `index.ts` files exporting only version constants. Zero implementation.\n- **Hello-world example:** Working Phaser scene proving SVG asset loading, tween animations, and text rendering. No interactivity or game logic. Establishes card dimensions (140x190px) and scene patterns.\n- **Assets:** 2 SVGs (ace of spades face, card back) at 140x190px in `public/assets/cards/`. Attribution in `CREDITS.md`.\n- **Tests:** Single smoke test confirming Vitest works. No meaningful game or engine tests.\n\n## Desired Change\n\nBuild a playable 9-Card Golf example game at `example-games/golf/` that exercises and populates the engine modules:\n\n- **card-system:** Implement Card type (rank, suit, faceUp), Deck (create, shuffle, draw), and Pile (push, pop, peek) abstractions. Add a Grid[3][3] type (may live locally in the golf game initially).\n- **rule-engine:** Implement Golf-specific turn logic (draw from pile or discard, replace grid card or discard drawn card), end-of-round detection (all cards face-up), and scoring rules.\n- **core-engine:** Implement minimal game state management and turn sequencing sufficient to drive a 2-player (human + AI) game loop.\n- **ui:** Build Phaser scene(s) for the golf game: 3x3 grid layout, draw/discard piles, card flip/swap animations, score display, turn indicators.\n- **AI player:** Implement two strategies (random valid move, greedy minimize-score) behind a selectable interface.\n- **Recording:** Produce a JSON game transcript per completed game. Per-turn visual snapshots are a stretch goal (see Risks & Assumptions).\n- **Card assets:** Source or generate a complete 52-card deck of face SVGs (CC0/permissive) at 140x190px. Update `public/assets/CREDITS.md` with attribution.\n- **Tests:** Unit tests for scoring logic (minimum 3 scenarios), turn legality, and deck operations. All tests must pass via `npm test`; build must succeed via `npm run build`.\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n### Risks\n- **Scope creep from engine extraction:** Building reusable engine modules alongside a game spike may slow progress. Mitigation: build game-specific implementations first, then extract to shared modules only where the abstraction is clear and stable.\n- **Card asset sourcing:** Finding or generating 52 CC0/permissive SVG card faces at consistent quality and dimensions (140x190px) may take non-trivial effort. Mitigation: consider programmatic SVG generation or an existing open-source deck (e.g., the SVG-cards GitHub repo).\n- **Visual replay deferred:** Per-turn screenshot capture is a stretch goal for this spike. A dedicated dev tool for game log playback and image capture (using Playwright or similar) will be built as a separate high-priority work item, blocked by this spike. See related work item below.\n- **Grid abstraction placement:** Unclear whether Grid[3][3] should live in card-system (reusable) or locally in the golf game. Mitigation: build locally first; extract after a second game validates the abstraction.\n\n### Assumptions\n- A standard 52-card deck (no jokers) is sufficient for 9-Card Golf.\n- The 9-card variant uses the scoring rules from Wikipedia (A=1, 2=-2, 3-10=face, J/Q=10, K=0, column-of-three=0). No house-rule variants are in scope.\n- Phaser 3.90.0's built-in scene management and tween system are sufficient for card flip/swap animations without additional libraries.\n- The AI player does not need to be competitive — it only needs to make legal moves to exercise game paths.\n\n## Suggested Next Step\n\nBreak CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB into child work items covering: card asset sourcing, card-system implementation, rule-engine (Golf scoring + turn logic), core-engine (game loop + state), UI (Phaser scenes), AI player, game recording, and test suite. Then begin implementation of the first child item per `wl next`.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **Game Log Visual Replay Dev Tool (CG-0MLSN2YWY1EL17FN):** High-priority feature to build a Playwright-based dev tool that replays JSON game transcripts and captures per-turn screenshots. Blocked by this spike (requires working game with transcript output).\n- **Scaffold Card Game Engine project (CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH):** Completed epic that set up the repository structure, toolchain, and empty module stubs. This spike builds directly on that foundation.\n- **Wikipedia — Golf (card game):** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_(card_game) — Canonical rules reference.\n- **BoardGameGeek — Golf:** https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Golf — Variant rules and community discussion.\n- **AGENTS.md:** Project rules, spike-driven development approach, engine architecture, and quality gates.\n- **docs/DEVELOPER.md:** Developer setup, build/test commands, and asset management.\n- **public/assets/CREDITS.md:** Asset attribution policy and suggested sources (OpenGameArt.org, Kenney.nl, SVG-cards repo).\n\n## Related work (automated report)\n\nSearched Worklog (keywords: golf, card, game, spike, scoring, grid, deck, phaser) and repository files. No duplicate work items found.\n\n### Worklog items\n\n- **Scaffold Card Game Engine project (CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH)** [completed]: Established the repository structure, Vite/TypeScript/Phaser toolchain, hello-world example, and empty engine module stubs. This spike is a direct dependency — it provides the foundation (build tooling, directory layout, card asset pipeline patterns) that the Golf spike will build on. The hello-world scene patterns (SVG loading at 140x190px, Phaser.Scene subclass, game config) serve as templates for the Golf scene implementation.\n\n- **Game Log Visual Replay Dev Tool (CG-0MLSN2YWY1EL17FN)** [blocked by this item]: High-priority feature to build a Playwright-based CLI tool that replays JSON game transcripts and captures per-turn screenshots. Directly blocked by this spike — it requires a working game producing JSON transcripts. The transcript format defined by this Golf spike will become the initial schema for the replay tool.\n\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** [blocked by this item]: Open solitaire spike with deterministic, all-face-up gameplay. Blocked by this spike because it will reuse Card, Deck, and Pile abstractions built here. Its tableau/foundation model will exercise different engine patterns (build-up-by-suit vs. Golf's grid/scoring), providing a second validation point for engine module APIs.\n\n- **Sushi Go! (CG-0MLSDWSCG154TUEL)**, **Splendor (CG-0MLSDX4B91DG6S1A)**, **Lost Cities (CG-0MLSDXELC06VESJL)**, **The Mind (CG-0MLSDXNMM1R2IMT9)**, **Coloretto (CG-0MLSDXY9F1FSGQ38)** [all blocked]: Five additional game spikes at idea stage. All will consume the card-system and core-engine modules first built by this Golf spike. Not directly related but will benefit from abstractions validated here.\n\n- **Add pre-commit hook to enforce doc updates (CG-0MLSHQMDY1H0I2B7)** [open]: Infrastructure task to add doc-update enforcement. Not directly related to this spike but the Golf spike should comply with the doc-update policy when making infrastructure changes.\n\n- **Rename project to Tableau Card Engine (CG-0MLSIULHH0Y6I3DV)** [completed]: Branding rename already applied. The Golf spike should use \"Tableau Card Engine\" / \"TCE\" naming consistently.\n\n### Repository files\n\n- **`example-games/hello-world/`**: Establishes the patterns this spike should follow — `main.ts` entry point, `scenes/` directory with Phaser.Scene subclass, SVG asset loading via `this.load.svg()` with explicit dimensions, game config with scale mode and parent container.\n\n- **`src/card-system/index.ts`**: Empty stub (exports only `CARD_SYSTEM_VERSION`). This spike must populate it with Card, Deck, and Pile abstractions.\n\n- **`src/core-engine/index.ts`**: Empty stub (exports only `ENGINE_VERSION`). This spike must add minimal game state management and turn sequencing.\n\n- **`src/rule-engine/index.ts`**: Empty stub (exports only `RULE_ENGINE_VERSION`). This spike must add Golf-specific turn logic and scoring.\n\n- **`src/ui/index.ts`**: Empty stub (exports only `UI_VERSION`). This spike must add Phaser scene components for the Golf game.\n\n- **`public/assets/cards/`**: Contains 2 placeholder SVGs (ace_of_spades.svg, card_back.svg) at 140x190px establishing the card asset format. This spike must source or generate the remaining 51 card faces.\n\n- **`public/assets/CREDITS.md`**: Documents asset attribution policy and suggests sources (OpenGameArt.org, Kenney.nl, SVG-cards GitHub repo). Must be updated when new card assets are added.\n\n- **`tests/smoke.test.ts`**: Trivial Vitest smoke test. This spike must add meaningful tests for scoring logic, turn legality, and deck operations alongside this existing test.","effort":"","id":"CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB","issueType":"epic","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":null,"priority":"critical","risk":"","sortIndex":300,"stage":"in_progress","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"9-Card Golf","updatedAt":"2026-02-19T04:07:54.456Z"},"type":"workitem"}

A single-player solitaire game is needed to validate and extend the engine for: single-player GameState, drag-and-drop card interaction, undo/redo state management, and auto-move heuristics. Beleaguered Castle's fully deterministic, open-information rules (all cards face-up) make it an ideal spike for these features without the complexity of hidden state.\n\n## Users\n\n- **Engine developer (primary):** Validates that the engine's modular architecture can support single-player games, drag-and-drop input, undo/redo, and auto-move. Uses the spike to extend core-engine for 1-player support and extract reusable patterns.\n  - *\"As an engine developer, I want to build a single-player solitaire game using the engine modules so I can identify gaps in single-player support, input handling, and state history management.\"*\n\n- **Solitaire player:** Plays Beleaguered Castle with modern digital solitaire UX: drag cards or click-to-move, undo/redo mistakes, and watch cards auto-move to foundations when safe.\n  - *\"As a player, I want to play Beleaguered Castle with both drag-and-drop and click-to-move input, full undo/redo, and auto-move to foundations so the game feels polished and responsive.\"*\n\n- **Game designer (future):** Uses the completed spike as a reference for building other solitaire-style games using the engine's new single-player, drag-and-drop, and undo/redo capabilities.\n  - *\"As a game designer, I want a working solitaire reference game that demonstrates drag-and-drop, undo/redo, and auto-move so I can quickly scaffold similar card games.\"*\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. **Playable classic Beleaguered Castle:** A player can play a complete game of Beleaguered Castle (classic deal: aces pre-placed on foundations, 48 cards dealt into 8 columns of 6) in a Phaser scene from deal to win or loss.\n2. **Dual input methods:** Cards can be moved via both drag-and-drop (drag from tableau pile to foundation or another tableau pile) and click-to-select/click-to-place. Invalid moves snap the card back / are rejected.\n3. **Full undo/redo:** A reusable undo/redo module in `src/core-engine/` supports unlimited undo/redo steps. The player can step backward and forward through their entire move history.\n4. **Auto-move to foundations + auto-complete:** Cards are automatically moved to foundations when safe to play (no tableau pile needs the card as a build target). When the remaining game is trivially winnable, auto-complete plays all remaining moves to completion.\n5. **Win and no-moves detection:** The game detects when the player wins (all cards on foundations) and when no legal moves remain (game over / stuck).\n6. **New game / restart:** The player can start a new game (fresh shuffle) or restart the current deal at any time via a UI button.\n7. **Single-player core-engine support:** `src/core-engine/` GameState is modified to allow 1 player, enabling all future solitaire games to use the shared engine.\n8. **JSON game transcript:** Each completed game produces a JSON transcript compatible with the existing Visual Replay Dev Tool.\n9. **Test coverage:** Unit tests cover: deal logic, move legality (valid and invalid moves), foundation build-up rules, win detection, no-moves detection, undo/redo operations, auto-move heuristics, and scoring (if applicable). All tests pass via `npm test`; build succeeds via `npm run build`.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **Classic deal only:** This work item covers the classic Beleaguered Castle deal (aces pre-placed on foundations, 48 cards into 8 columns of 6). The Citadel variant (all 52 cards in tableau) is tracked separately as CG-0MLTDXG3H0WCXMUV.\n- **Single-player only:** No AI opponent or solver. The player makes all decisions.\n- **Card assets already available:** A full 52-card SVG deck at 140x190px exists in `public/assets/cards/` (CC0 licensed). No new art assets are needed.\n- **Rule engine still a stub:** The rule engine (`src/rule-engine/`) remains an empty stub. Beleaguered Castle rules should be built locally in the game first; extraction to the rule engine is out of scope unless a clear reusable pattern emerges.\n- **Licensing:** All code and assets must be open and freely available for commercial use per project policy.\n- **Layout:** Foundations across the top, 8 tableau columns below (digital solitaire convention, not the traditional center-foundations layout).\n\n## Existing State\n\n- **Card system (src/card-system/):** Mature. Card, Deck, Pile types with full test coverage. Pile supports LIFO push/pop/peek operations suitable for foundations and tableau columns.\n- **Core engine (src/core-engine/):** Functional. GameState<T> and TurnSequencer, but requires 2+ players. Must be modified for single-player support.\n- **Rule engine (src/rule-engine/):** Empty stub (version constant only).\n- **UI (src/ui/):** HelpPanel and HelpButton components available. No drag-and-drop, card sprite, or game-play UI components exist.\n- **Golf example game (example-games/golf/):** Completed first spike. Establishes patterns for: scene structure, game logic separation (rules/scoring as pure functions), AI strategies, game transcripts, browser tests with Phaser, and help panel integration.\n- **Card assets:** 52 SVG card faces + card back at 140x190px in `public/assets/cards/`. CC0 licensed from saulspatz/SVGCards.\n- **No solitaire-specific code exists:** No foundation logic, tableau column logic, drag-and-drop, auto-move, or undo/redo anywhere in the codebase.\n\n## Desired Change\n\nBuild a playable Beleaguered Castle example game at `example-games/beleaguered-castle/` that introduces single-player, drag-and-drop, undo/redo, and auto-move capabilities:\n\n- **core-engine (single-player):** Modify `createGameState()` to accept 1 player. Ensure TurnSequencer works correctly for single-player (turn \"advancement\" is a no-op or simply increments the move counter).\n- **core-engine (undo/redo):** Build a reusable `UndoRedoManager` module in `src/core-engine/` that maintains a history stack of game states and supports unlimited undo/redo.\n- **Game logic (example-games/beleaguered-castle/):**\n  - Deal module: shuffle deck, remove aces to foundations, deal 48 cards into 8 columns of 6 (all face-up).\n  - Move rules: move top card of any tableau column to a foundation (if next in suit sequence) or to another tableau column (if one rank lower, regardless of suit). Empty columns accept any card.\n  - Win detection: all 52 cards on foundations.\n  - No-moves detection: no legal moves remain across all tableau columns.\n  - Auto-move: automatically move cards to foundations when safe (no tableau column needs the card). Auto-complete when trivially solvable.\n- **Phaser UI (example-games/beleaguered-castle/scenes/):**\n  - Layout: 4 foundation piles across the top, 8 tableau columns below.\n  - Dual input: drag-and-drop cards between piles, or click-to-select then click-to-place.\n  - Visual feedback: highlight valid drop targets, snap-back for invalid moves, card flip animations for foundation placement.\n  - Undo/redo buttons and keyboard shortcuts.\n  - Win/loss overlays.\n  - Help panel with game rules (using reusable HelpPanel component).\n- **Game transcript:** Produce a JSON transcript per completed game, compatible with the Visual Replay Dev Tool.\n- **Tests:** Unit tests for deal logic, move legality, foundation rules, win/no-moves detection, undo/redo, and auto-move. Browser tests for Phaser rendering and interaction. All tests pass via `npm test`; build succeeds via `npm run build`.\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n### Risks\n- **Drag-and-drop complexity:** Implementing reliable drag-and-drop with Phaser (setDraggable, drag zones, drop zones, snap-back) is significantly more complex than click input. May require substantial iteration on hit detection and visual feedback.\n- **Undo/redo state size:** Storing full game state snapshots for unlimited undo/redo could consume significant memory for long games. Mitigation: use a command pattern (store moves, not states) or delta-based approach to minimize memory usage.\n- **Auto-move correctness:** Determining whether a card is \"safe\" to auto-move to a foundation requires checking whether any tableau column still needs the card as a build target. The heuristic must be conservative to avoid auto-moving cards that the player might want to keep available for tableau building. Mitigation: start with a simple safe-move heuristic and iterate.\n- **Auto-complete detection:** Determining when the game is \"trivially winnable\" is non-trivial (requires checking that all remaining tableau cards can be played to foundations in some order). Mitigation: use a simple heuristic (e.g., all tableau cards are in ascending order within their columns) rather than a full solver.\n- **Core-engine single-player change scope:** Modifying GameState to allow 1 player may have ripple effects on TurnSequencer and any code that assumes 2+ players. Mitigation: make the change backward-compatible and verify all existing Golf tests still pass.\n- **Low win rate:** Beleaguered Castle has a relatively low win rate (~30% of random deals are solvable). Players may encounter many unwinnable deals. Mitigation: the no-moves detection will inform the player when they are stuck, and new-game/restart options allow quick recovery.\n- **Undo/redo interaction with auto-move:** Undoing a move that triggered one or more auto-moves must correctly undo the entire chain (auto-moves + player move). Failure to do so would leave the game in an inconsistent state. Mitigation: treat auto-move chains as part of the triggering move in the undo history.\n\n### Assumptions\n- A standard 52-card deck (no jokers) is used.\n- Beleaguered Castle uses the classic rules from Wikipedia: aces pre-placed on foundations, build foundations up by suit (A to K), build tableau columns down regardless of suit, only top card of each column is available, empty columns accept any card.\n- Phaser 3.90.0's built-in drag-and-drop support (setDraggable, drag events, drop zones) is sufficient without additional libraries.\n- The undo/redo module does not need to support branching history (tree-based undo); a simple linear stack is sufficient.\n- The game does not need a solver or hint system for this spike.\n- The JSON transcript format can follow the same general structure as the Golf transcript, adapted for solitaire moves.\n\n## Suggested Next Step\n\nBreak CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB into child work items covering: core-engine single-player support, undo/redo module, Beleaguered Castle game logic (deal, rules, win/loss detection), auto-move heuristics, Phaser UI (layout, drag-and-drop, click-to-move, visual feedback), game transcript recording, help panel integration, and test suite. Then begin implementation per `wl next`.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)** [completed]: First game spike.

No duplicate work items found.\n\n### Worklog items\n\n- **9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)** [completed]: The primary reference implementation. Its game logic architecture (pure rule functions separated from Phaser scene, game transcript recording, browser tests with headless Chromium) establishes the patterns Beleaguered Castle should follow. Key differences: Golf is multi-player with AI; Beleaguered Castle is single-player with undo/redo and drag-and-drop.\n\n- **Card System Engine Module (CG-0MLSPHOWY1HSCIDX)** [completed]: Provides Card, Deck, and Pile types. The Pile class (LIFO push/pop/peek) is directly suitable for both foundation piles (build up by suit) and tableau columns (build down regardless of suit). No modifications to card-system are expected.\n\n- **Core Engine Turn Sequencer (CG-0MLSPHU1C02RAGE0)** [completed]: Provides GameState<T> and TurnSequencer. Currently enforces a minimum of 2 players in `createGameState()` -- this constraint must be relaxed to support single-player solitaire. The TurnSequencer's `advanceTurn()` rotation logic will need adaptation for single-player (move counter only).\n\n- **Game Log Visual Replay Dev Tool (CG-0MLSN2YWY1EL17FN)** [open]: JSON transcript replay tool. Beleaguered Castle should produce transcripts in a compatible format. The solitaire transcript schema will differ from Golf's (single-player moves, auto-moves, undo/redo events) but should share the same envelope structure.\n\n- **Help Screen with Game Rules (CG-0MLT0PM000TQRIXT)** [completed]: Reusable HelpPanel and HelpButton components in `src/ui/`. Beleaguered Castle should integrate these with game-specific help content describing the deal, move rules, undo/redo shortcuts, and auto-move behavior.\n\n- **Card Asset Pipeline (CG-0MLSPHIDD19PBDOZ)** [completed]: The full 52-card SVG deck is already available at `public/assets/cards/` (CC0 licensed, 140x190px). No new assets needed for Beleaguered Castle.\n\n- **Scaffold Card Game Engine project (CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH)** [completed]: Established the repository structure, toolchain (Vite, TypeScript, Phaser, Vitest), and path aliases. Beleaguered Castle builds on this foundation.\n\n- **Citadel variant option (CG-0MLTDXG3H0WCXMUV)** [open]: Created during this intake. Follow-on work to add a Citadel deal variant (all 52 cards in tableau, no aces pre-placed) as a selectable option within the Beleaguered Castle game.\n\n- **Coloretto (CG-0MLSDXY9F1FSGQ38)** [blocked]: Set-building tableau game. While not directly related, it is another planned game spike that will benefit from the drag-and-drop and single-player engine features built by this spike.\n\n### Repository files\n\n- **`example-games/golf/`**: Full reference implementation. Key files to study: `GolfGame.ts` (game orchestration pattern), `GolfRules.ts` (pure rule functions), `GolfScoring.ts` (scoring logic), `GameTranscript.ts` (transcript recording), `scenes/GolfScene.ts` (Phaser scene with state-machine-driven UI flow).\n\n- **`src/card-system/Pile.ts`**: LIFO stack abstraction documented as suitable for \"draw piles, discard piles, foundations, and any other ordered collection of cards.\" Beleaguered Castle will use Pile instances for both the 4 foundations and 8 tableau columns.\n\n- **`src/core-engine/GameState.ts`**: The `createGameState()` function at line 48 enforces `players.length >= 2`. This validation must be changed to `>= 1` for single-player support, with existing tests verified to still pass.\n\n- **`src/core-engine/TurnSequencer.ts`**: The `advanceTurn()` function uses modular arithmetic (`(currentPlayerIndex + 1) % players.length`) which would work correctly for a single player (always index 0). The main concern is whether consumers assume multi-player behavior.\n\n- **`src/ui/HelpPanel.ts`** and **`src/ui/HelpButton.ts`**: Reusable UI components for in-game help. Already integrated in the Golf game via `help-content.json`. Beleaguered Castle should follow the same pattern with its own help content file.\n\n- **`public/assets/cards/`**: 52 SVG card faces + card back, all at 140x190px. File naming convention: `{rank}_of_{suit}.svg`. All assets are CC0 licensed per `CREDITS.md`.\n\n- **`docs/DEVELOPER.md`**: Section \"Adding a New Example Game\" describes the steps for creating a new game under `example-games/`. Beleaguered Castle should follow this guide.","effort":"","id":"CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB","issueType":"epic","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":null,"priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":400,"stage":"in_progress","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Beleaguered Castle (open solitaire)","updatedAt":"2026-02-19T13:42:34.965Z"},"type":"workitem"}

{"data":{"assignee":"Map","createdAt":"2026-02-18T19:41:35.196Z","createdBy":"","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","dependencies":[],"description":"# Scaffold Card Game Engine Project\n\n> **Headline**: Set up the Card Game Spikes repository with Phaser 3.x, TypeScript, Vite, and Vitest as a flat monorepo, unblocking all 7 planned game spikes.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe Card Game Spikes project is a completely greenfield repository with no source code, build tooling, or directory structure. All 7 planned example game spikes (9-Card Golf, Beleaguered Castle, Sushi Go!, Splendor, Lost Cities, The Mind, Coloretto) are blocked until a working project foundation is in place. A properly scaffolded project with build, test, and dev-server tooling is required before any game development can begin.\n\n## Users\n\n- **Game developers (internal)**: Agents and contributors who will implement the example card games and extract reusable engine components.\n  - *As a game developer, I want to run a single command to start a dev server with hot-reload so I can iterate quickly on game code.*\n  - *As a game developer, I want TypeScript configured with strict mode so I catch type errors early.*\n  - *As a game developer, I want a clear directory structure so I know where to put shared engine code vs. game-specific code.*\n- **Engine consumers (future)**: Developers who will reuse extracted engine modules for their own card games.\n  - *As an engine consumer, I want shared modules (core-engine, card-system, rule-engine) organized in a discoverable way so I can import only what I need.*\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. Running `npm install && npm run dev` starts a Vite dev server that renders a minimal Phaser 3.x \"hello world\" scene in the browser (a card sprite or text on a colored background).\n2. Running `npm test` executes Vitest and at least one passing unit test completes successfully.\n3. Running `npm run build` produces a production bundle in a `dist/` directory without errors.\n4. The directory structure includes clearly separated areas for shared engine modules (`src/core-engine/`, `src/card-system/`, `src/rule-engine/`, `src/ui/`) and example games (`example-games/`), with each example game having its own entry point and scene(s).\n5. A git repository is initialized with a proper `.gitignore` (covering `node_modules/`, `dist/`, IDE files, OS files) and an initial commit containing the full scaffold.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **Phaser 3.x (latest stable, currently 3.90.0)**: The AGENTS.md originally specified \"Phaser 4\" but this does not exist as a stable release. Phaser 3.x is the current community standard.\n- **Vite**: Replaces Webpack as specified in AGENTS.md. Vite is officially supported by Phaser's project scaffolder and offers faster dev builds and HMR.\n- **Vitest**: Replaces Jest as specified in AGENTS.md. Vitest integrates natively with Vite, uses the same API as Jest, and avoids ESM/CJS compatibility friction.\n- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, targeting modern browsers (ES2020+).\n- **Flat monorepo**: Single `package.json` at root. Shared engine code in `src/` subdirectories, example games in `example-games/` with their own scenes and entry points. No npm workspaces for now.\n- **Open-source licensing**: All dependencies and assets must be permissively licensed (MIT, Apache 2.0, CC0, etc.) and suitable for commercial use.\n- **AGENTS.md must be updated** to reflect the actual tech stack decisions (Phaser 3.x, Vite, Vitest, flat monorepo structure).\n\n## Existing State\n\n- The repository contains only `AGENTS.md`, `.gitignore` (minimal, Worklog-focused), and `.worklog/` data.\n- No git repository is initialized (no `.git/` directory).\n- No `package.json`, no TypeScript config, no build tooling, no source files, no tests.\n- 7 game spike work items exist in Worklog, all at \"idea\" stage, all blocked pending scaffolding.\n\n## Desired Change\n\nAfter this work item is completed, the repository will contain:\n\n- **Git repository**: Initialized with a proper `.gitignore` and initial commit.\n- **`package.json`**: With Phaser 3.x, TypeScript, Vite, and Vitest as dependencies; scripts for `dev`, `build`, `test`, and `preview`.\n- **`tsconfig.json`**: Strict TypeScript configuration targeting ES2020, with Phaser type definitions.\n- **`vite.config.ts`**: Configured for Phaser 3.x development with dev server and production build.\n- **Directory structure**:\n  ```\n  cardGameSpikes/\n  ├── src/\n  │   ├── core-engine/       # Game loop, state management, rendering helpers\n  │   ├── card-system/       # Card definitions, deck, hand, pile abstractions\n  │   ├── rule-engine/       # Rule definitions, validation, turn logic\n  │   └── ui/                # Reusable UI components (buttons, menus, overlays)\n  ├── example-games/\n  │   └── hello-world/       # Minimal Phaser scene proving toolchain works\n  │       ├── scenes/\n  │       └── main.ts\n  ├── public/                # Static assets (HTML, images, fonts)\n  ├── tests/                 # Vitest test files\n  ├── dist/                  # Production build output (gitignored)\n  ├── AGENTS.md              # Updated with actual tech stack\n  ├── package.json\n  ├── tsconfig.json\n  ├── vite.config.ts\n  └── .gitignore             # Comprehensive Node.js/TS/Vite ignores\n  ```\n- **Hello-world scene**: A minimal Phaser 3.x scene that renders on screen, proving Vite + Phaser + TypeScript integration works end-to-end.\n- **One passing Vitest test**: Demonstrating the test framework is wired up correctly.\n- **Updated AGENTS.md**: Reflecting Phaser 3.x, Vite, Vitest, and the actual directory structure.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)** - First game spike, directly unblocked by this scaffolding.\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** - Solitaire spike, blocked.\n- **Sushi Go! (CG-0MLSDWSCG154TUEL)** - Drafting game spike, blocked.\n- **Splendor (CG-0MLSDX4B91DG6S1A)** - Engine-building game spike, blocked.\n- **Lost Cities (CG-0MLSDXELC06VESJL)** - 2-player lanes spike, blocked.\n- **The Mind (CG-0MLSDXNMM1R2IMT9)** - Open-hand variant spike, blocked.\n- **Coloretto (CG-0MLSDXY9F1FSGQ38)** - Set-building tableau spike, blocked.\n- **Official Phaser Webpack-TS template** (https://github.com/phaserjs/template-webpack-ts) - Reference for Phaser + TypeScript project structure.\n- **Phaser `create-phaser-game` CLI** - Official scaffolder supporting Vite + TypeScript templates.\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n- **Risk**: Phaser 3.x may not work seamlessly with Vite out of the box (e.g., global `Phaser` variable, canvas/WebGL initialization). *Mitigation*: The official `create-phaser-game` CLI has a Vite template, so this path is well-trodden.\n- **Risk**: The flat monorepo approach may not scale if engine modules need independent versioning later. *Mitigation*: Acceptable for a spike-driven project; migration to workspaces can be done later without major refactoring.\n- **Assumption**: Phaser 3.x TypeScript definitions are up-to-date and compatible with strict mode (they are shipped in the `phaser` npm package under `types/`).\n- **Assumption**: A single Vite entry point can serve multiple example games. If not, a per-game Vite config or multi-page setup may be needed (discoverable during first game spike implementation).\n- **Assumption**: No CI/CD pipeline is needed in this scaffolding phase; local `npm test` and `npm run build` are sufficient validation.\n\n## Suggested Next Step\n\nBreak this epic into child work items for implementation: (1) git init + .gitignore, (2) package.json + Vite + TypeScript config, (3) directory structure + placeholder modules, (4) hello-world Phaser scene, (5) Vitest setup + first test, (6) AGENTS.md update. Then implement starting from work item CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH.\n\n## Related work (automated report)\n\nSearched Worklog (keyword: scaffold, setup, phaser, card game) and repository files. No duplicate or prior scaffolding work items found.\n\n- **AGENTS.md** (`/AGENTS.md`): The project charter defining the vision, directory structure, and tech stack for the Card Game Engine. This scaffolding work item directly implements the foundational setup described in AGENTS.md, with agreed deviations (Phaser 3.x instead of 4, Vite instead of Webpack, Vitest instead of Jest).\n- **9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)**: The first and highest-priority game spike. It is directly unblocked by this scaffolding and will be the first consumer of the project structure, Phaser integration, and test framework established here. Its description references `Phaser Container` which validates the need for a working Phaser setup.\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)**, **Sushi Go! (CG-0MLSDWSCG154TUEL)**, **Splendor (CG-0MLSDX4B91DG6S1A)**, **Lost Cities (CG-0MLSDXELC06VESJL)**, **The Mind (CG-0MLSDXNMM1R2IMT9)**, **Coloretto (CG-0MLSDXY9F1FSGQ38)**: All 6 remaining game spikes are blocked pending scaffolding. Each references card abstractions (Card, Deck, Pile, Hand, etc.) that will live in the `src/card-system/` module created by this work.\n- **Official Phaser Webpack-TS template** (https://github.com/phaserjs/template-webpack-ts): The community reference implementation for Phaser + TypeScript project structure. While this project uses Vite instead of Webpack, the template's `src/` layout (scenes, game config, main entry point) is a useful structural reference.\n- **Phaser `create-phaser-game` CLI**: The official Phaser scaffolder supports Vite + TypeScript templates and should be consulted during implementation for best-practice Vite configuration patterns.","effort":"","id":"CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH","issueType":"epic","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":null,"priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":1000,"stage":"in_review","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Scaffold Card Game Engine project","updatedAt":"2026-02-18T20:56:08.467Z"},"type":"workitem"}

{"data":{"assignee":"opencode","createdAt":"2026-02-18T23:04:21.826Z","createdBy":"","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","dependencies":[{"from":"CG-0MLSN2YWY1EL17FN","to":"CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB"}],"description":"# Intake Brief: Game Log Visual Replay Dev Tool (CG-0MLSN2YWY1EL17FN)\n\n**Priority: High** | **Type: Feature** | **Assignee: Map**\n\n> Playwright-driven dev tool that replays JSON game transcripts, captures per-turn screenshots, and supports live browser takeover for interactive bug reproduction.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe Tableau Card Engine produces JSON game transcripts capturing every turn, but there is no way to visually replay a recorded game. Developers debugging game logic or UI issues must manually play through games to reproduce bugs, and there is no automated way to generate screenshots or videos of completed games for visual verification, regression testing, or documentation.\n\n## Users\n\n- **Engine developer:** Needs to visually verify that game state rendering matches expected behavior across all turns, catch rendering bugs, and reproduce reported visual issues without manual play.\n  - *\"As an engine developer, I want to replay a recorded game transcript and see per-turn screenshots so I can verify rendering correctness and visually debug game state issues.\"*\n\n- **QA / tester:** Needs to generate reproducible visual evidence of bugs and regressions by replaying specific game transcripts that trigger known issues.\n  - *\"As a QA tester, I want to replay a game transcript that reproduces a bug, pause at the problematic turn, and take over interactively to investigate the issue in a live browser.\"*\n\n- **Game designer:** Needs to review complete game playthroughs visually without playing them, for tuning game feel, animations, and UI layout.\n  - *\"As a game designer, I want to watch a recorded game play back visually so I can evaluate the game's visual presentation and identify UI improvements.\"*\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. **Screenshot capture:** Running `npm run replay -- data/transcripts/golf/game-001.json --output data/screenshots/golf/game-001/` replays the transcript in a headless Playwright browser and produces a PNG screenshot after each turn, saved to the specified output directory.\n2. **Transcript auto-save:** Games automatically save completed transcripts to browser storage (IndexedDB preferred, localStorage fallback) with a rolling window of the last 10 games. A CLI script (`npm run transcripts:export -- golf`) extracts transcripts from browser storage to `data/transcripts/golf/` on disk. An in-game export button also allows manual JSON download.\n3. **Partial replay with takeover:** The replay tool supports `--stop-at <turn>` (e.g., `npm run replay -- transcript.json --stop-at 12`) which pauses replay at the specified turn and keeps the browser open in non-headless mode, allowing the developer to take manual control and play from that point.\n4. **Engine event system:** The core engine module (`src/core-engine/`) emits standardized events (`turn-started`, `turn-completed`, `animation-complete`, `state-settled`, `game-ended`) that the replay tool listens for to ensure precise timing between turns.\n5. **Golf game support:** The tool works with the existing 9-Card Golf transcript format (version 1) as the initial supported game, with architecture designed to support additional games without major refactoring.\n6. **Documentation:** `docs/DEVELOPER.md` is updated with usage instructions for the replay tool, transcript auto-save/export, and the engine event system.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **Canvas-based rendering:** Phaser renders to a WebGL/Canvas element, not DOM. Playwright cannot use CSS selectors for game elements. The tool must use coordinate-based clicking or the game must expose hit area information for reliable interaction.\n- **Browser storage for persistence:** Transcripts are saved to localStorage/IndexedDB since the game runs in a browser and the Vite dev server does not natively support disk writes. A separate CLI step is needed to extract transcripts to disk files.\n- **Playwright dependency:** Playwright is already a devDependency (^1.58.2) used for Vitest browser tests. The replay tool must not conflict with the existing test configuration.\n- **Existing transcript schema:** The tool must consume the existing `GameTranscript` format (version 1) defined in `example-games/golf/GameTranscript.ts`. Changes to the schema should be backward-compatible.\n- **Video capture is a stretch goal:** Per-turn PNG screenshots are the primary output. Stitching screenshots into a video or recording continuous video is deferred to a follow-up enhancement.\n- **Licensing:** All new dependencies must be permissively licensed (MIT, Apache 2.0, CC0, or similar).\n\n## Existing State\n\n- **Transcript system:** A well-tested `TranscriptRecorder` class exists in `example-games/golf/GameTranscript.ts` that captures complete board state per turn (player grids, discard pile, stock count, scores). The transcript is currently held in-memory only and used for the end-of-game results screen.\n- **Transcript format:** Version 1 schema is defined as TypeScript interfaces (`GameTranscript`, `TurnRecord`, `BoardSnapshot`, `CardSnapshot`, `GameResults`). Comprehensive unit and integration tests validate transcript correctness and JSON round-trip serialization.\n- **Playwright integration:** Already installed as a devDependency and configured as the Vitest browser test provider (headless Chromium). Browser tests exist for Golf UI interactions (`tests/golf/GolfInteraction.browser.test.ts`).\n- **No replay tool:** No replay, playback, or screenshot capture functionality exists. No dev tools infrastructure exists. No `tools/` directory.\n- **No transcript persistence:** Transcripts are not saved to disk or browser storage. They exist only in-memory during a game session.\n- **No engine event system:** The core engine does not emit events for turn lifecycle or animation timing. The Golf scene manages its own animation callbacks internally.\n\n## Desired Change\n\nBuild a developer replay tool with these capabilities:\n\n### Transcript Persistence (child task)\n- Implement auto-save of completed game transcripts to browser storage (localStorage or IndexedDB) after each game.\n- Maintain a rolling window of the last 10 transcripts per game.\n- Add an in-game export button that downloads the current transcript as a JSON file.\n- Create a CLI extraction script (`npm run transcripts:export`) that uses Playwright to connect to the game, read transcripts from browser storage, and write them as JSON files to `data/transcripts/<game>/`.\n- Add `data/` to `.gitignore`.\n\n### Core Engine Event System (child task)\n- Add a standardized event emitter to the core engine module (`src/core-engine/`) that games can use to signal turn lifecycle events.\n- Define events: `turn-started`, `turn-completed`, `animation-complete`, `state-settled`, `game-ended`.\n- Integrate the event system into the Golf scene so it emits these events at appropriate points.\n- Design for reuse across all example games.\n\n### Replay Tool (primary deliverable)\n- Create an npm script entry point (`npm run replay`) that accepts a transcript JSON file path and replays it.\n- Use Playwright to launch the game in a headless browser, then drive it through recorded turns using coordinate-based UI automation.\n- Use core engine events to synchronize between turns (wait for `state-settled` before capturing screenshots and advancing).\n- Capture a PNG screenshot of the Phaser canvas after each turn, saved to a configurable output directory (default: `data/screenshots/<game>/<timestamp>/`).\n- Support `--stop-at <turn>` to pause at a specific turn, switch to non-headless mode, and hand the browser off to the developer for interactive takeover.\n- Produce a summary report (JSON) listing turns replayed, screenshot paths, and any errors encountered.\n- Design the tool architecture to be game-agnostic where possible, with game-specific adapters for translating transcript moves into UI interactions.\n\n### Documentation\n- Update `docs/DEVELOPER.md` with usage instructions for the replay tool, transcript export, and the engine event system.\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n### Risks\n- **Canvas interaction reliability:** Coordinate-based clicking on Phaser canvas elements may be fragile if game layout changes or window size varies. Mitigation: use the engine event system and game-exposed hit area data to improve targeting; pin viewport dimensions during replay.\n- **Animation timing:** Replaying turns faster than animations complete could cause visual artifacts or incorrect screenshots. Mitigation: the engine event system (`state-settled` event) ensures the tool waits for animations to finish before capturing.\n- **Browser storage limits:** localStorage has a ~5-10MB limit; 10 transcripts of complex games could approach this. Mitigation: use IndexedDB (larger quota) or compress transcripts before storage.\n- **Scope creep:** This work item touches multiple systems (persistence, events, UI automation, CLI tooling). Mitigation: break into child tasks, implement incrementally, and record additional feature ideas (video capture, multi-game support) as separate work items rather than expanding scope.\n- **Cross-game generalization:** Designing the event system and replay architecture for reuse before a second game validates it may lead to premature abstraction. Mitigation: implement for Golf first, keep interfaces minimal, refactor when Beleaguered Castle or another game adds replay support.\n- **Dev server dependency:** The replay tool assumes a running Vite dev server at `localhost:3000`. If the server is not running, replay will fail silently or with an unclear error. Mitigation: the replay script should check for a running server before launching Playwright and provide a clear error message with instructions to start the dev server.\n- **Transcript schema drift:** If the transcript format evolves (e.g., for Beleaguered Castle), older transcripts may become incompatible. Mitigation: the transcript schema includes a `version` field; the replay tool should validate the version and fail gracefully with a clear message if the format is unsupported.\n\n### Assumptions\n- Playwright's canvas screenshot API produces sufficiently high-quality captures of the Phaser rendering for visual verification.\n- The existing Golf scene's UI layout is stable enough for coordinate-based interaction (card positions, pile locations are deterministic for a given viewport size).\n- The `state-settled` event pattern is sufficient for synchronizing between turns without needing frame-level precision.\n- IndexedDB or localStorage provides adequate storage for 10 rolling transcripts without performance issues.\n- The Vite dev server will be running when the replay tool is invoked (the tool connects to `localhost:3000`).\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)** [completed]: The first game spike. Produces the game transcripts this tool will consume. Transcript format defined in `example-games/golf/GameTranscript.ts`.\n- **Game Transcript Recording (CG-0MLSPIQ1516DJNQL)** [completed]: Implemented the `TranscriptRecorder` class and transcript schema used by this tool.\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** [in-progress]: Second game spike. Will be a consumer of the replay tool and engine event system once completed.\n- **Scaffold Card Game Engine (CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH)** [completed]: Established the repository structure and tooling this tool builds on.\n- **Golf browser tests** (`tests/golf/GolfInteraction.browser.test.ts`): Existing Playwright-based UI tests for the Golf scene. Demonstrates patterns for Phaser canvas interaction via Playwright that the replay tool can build on.\n\n## Suggested Next Step\n\nBreak CG-0MLSN2YWY1EL17FN into child work items covering: transcript persistence (auto-save + export), core engine event system, replay tool implementation, and documentation. Then begin implementation per `wl next`.\n\n\n## Related work (automated report)\n\nSearched Worklog (39 items) and repository files for keywords: replay, transcript, screenshot, Playwright, event, persistence, browser, automation, canvas, dev tool, recording, game log. The following items have clear, direct relevance to the Game Log Visual Replay Dev Tool.\n\n### Worklog items\n\n- **9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)** [completed]: The first game spike and a formal dependency (via `wl dep`). Produces the JSON game transcripts this tool will consume. The transcript format (version 1) and TranscriptRecorder class were built as part of this epic. The replay tool requires a working game to replay against.\n\n- **Game Transcript Recording (CG-0MLSPIQ1516DJNQL)** [completed]: Implemented the `TranscriptRecorder` class, `GameTranscript` schema (version 1), and JSON round-trip serialization in `example-games/golf/GameTranscript.ts`. This is the direct data source the replay tool will consume. Its description explicitly references CG-0MLSN2YWY1EL17FN as a downstream consumer.\n\n- **Phaser UI Browser Testing with Vitest (CG-0MLSUJIE30K54IUO)** [completed]: Established the Playwright + Vitest browser mode infrastructure (headless Chromium, `*.browser.test.ts` convention, viewport pinning) that the replay tool can reuse for launching and automating the Phaser game. Demonstrates patterns for accessing the game instance via `window.__PHASER_GAME__` and interacting with canvas-rendered content.\n\n- **Investigate and fix broken Golf UI interactions (CG-0MLSW8TKZ0YHXJR2)** [completed]: Fixed click handling, turn flow, and AI execution in the Golf scene. The interaction patterns validated here (click stock pile, click grid cards, AI turn execution) are the same actions the replay tool must automate via Playwright coordinate-based clicks.\n\n- **Core Engine Turn Sequencer (CG-0MLSPHU1C02RAGE0)** [completed]: Provides the game state management and turn sequencing foundation in `src/core-engine/`. The replay tool's engine event system (Success Criterion #4: `turn-started`, `turn-completed`, `state-settled`, etc.) will extend this module with event emission capabilities.\n\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** [open]: The second game spike. Will be a future consumer of the replay tool and engine event system. The replay tool architecture should be game-agnostic enough to support this game once it is complete, validating the adapter pattern.\n\n- **Scaffold Card Game Engine project (CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH)** [completed]: Established repository structure, Vite/TypeScript toolchain, and module layout. The replay tool builds on this infrastructure (npm scripts, path aliases, build pipeline).\n\n### Repository files\n\n- **`example-games/golf/GameTranscript.ts`**: Defines the `GameTranscript`, `TurnRecord`, `BoardSnapshot`, and `CardSnapshot` TypeScript interfaces that the replay tool will parse. Also contains the `TranscriptRecorder` class. This is the primary data contract the replay tool depends on.\n\n- **`tests/golf/GameTranscript.test.ts`**: Unit tests for transcript recording and schema validation. Demonstrates how to create, populate, and finalize transcripts programmatically — useful reference for the replay tool's transcript parsing logic.\n\n- **`tests/golf/Integration.test.ts`**: Integration tests that run complete AI-vs-AI games and validate transcript output. Shows end-to-end transcript generation patterns and provides example transcripts the replay tool can use for testing.\n\n- **`tests/golf/GolfInteraction.browser.test.ts`**: Playwright-based browser tests for Golf UI interactions (click handling, turn flow). Demonstrates coordinate-based Phaser canvas interaction patterns that the replay tool must replicate for driving turns via UI automation.\n\n- **`tests/golf/GolfScene.browser.test.ts`**: Browser tests verifying Phaser game boot, rendering, and canvas presence. Shows how to launch the game in headless Chromium and access game state via `window.__PHASER_GAME__` — directly applicable to the replay tool's browser automation.\n\n- **`example-games/golf/main.ts`**: Entry point that exposes the Phaser game instance via `window.__PHASER_GAME__` (line 13). The replay tool will use this global reference to synchronize with game state and listen for engine events.\n\n- **`vite.config.ts`**: Configures Playwright as the Vitest browser test provider with headless Chromium and pinned viewport (900x700). The replay tool must be compatible with this configuration and may reuse the same Playwright setup for launching the game.\n\n- **`src/core-engine/index.ts`**: Barrel file for the core engine module.

This addresses the broken UI that currently has no automated test coverage.\n\n## User Story\n\nAs an engine developer, I want automated browser tests that verify the Phaser game renders correctly and responds to user interactions, so that UI regressions are caught before they reach players.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe Golf Phaser UI (GolfScene.ts) has 674 lines of rendering and interaction code with zero automated test coverage. The UI is reported broken but there is no way to detect or prevent regressions. Phaser requires a real browser (WebGL/Canvas) and cannot run in JSDOM or happy-dom.\n\n## Approach\n\n- Use Vitest 3.x browser mode with `@vitest/browser` package and Playwright provider\n- Configure test projects in vite.config.ts to run Node-based unit tests (`*.test.ts`) and browser-based tests (`*.browser.test.ts`) together via `npm test`\n- Browser tests run in headless Chromium via Playwright\n- Tests verify: canvas renders, game objects exist, basic interaction works\n- Access Phaser game instance via `window.__PHASER_GAME__` for state assertions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. `@vitest/browser` and `playwright` are installed as dev dependencies\n2. `vite.config.ts` uses `test.projects` to define both unit and browser test configurations\n3. Browser tests use `*.browser.test.ts` naming convention\n4. At least one browser test verifies the Phaser canvas renders in the game container\n5.

{"data":{"assignee":"opencode","createdAt":"2026-02-19T05:25:53.184Z","createdBy":"","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","dependencies":[],"description":"# Intake Brief: Help Screen with Game Rules and Instructions (CG-0MLT0PM000TQRIXT)\n\n**Priority: Medium** | **Type: Feature** | **Assignee: Map**\n\n> Add a reusable left-side help panel to the engine's UI module (`src/ui/`) that accepts an array of `{ heading, body }` content sections from each game, and integrate it into the 9-Card Golf example with rules overview, turn flow, scoring, and how-to-play instructions.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nPlayers of Tableau Card Engine games currently have no way to learn the rules or how to play within the game itself. Rules exist only as code comments and developer documentation. A reusable, engine-level help panel is needed so that each game can surface its own rules and instructions to players without building custom UI from scratch.\n\n## Users\n\n- **Player (primary):** Wants to quickly reference the rules and how-to-play instructions without leaving the game.\n  - *\"As a player, I want to press a help button or keyboard shortcut to see the game's rules and instructions in a side panel so I can learn how to play or refresh my memory mid-game.\"*\n\n- **Game developer (secondary):** Wants a ready-made, configurable help panel component they can populate with game-specific content.\n  - *\"As a game developer, I want to pass an array of content sections (heading + body) to a reusable help panel component so that I don't have to build help screen UI from scratch for each new game.\"*\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. **Reusable engine component:** A `HelpPanel` (or equivalent) class exists in `src/ui/` that accepts an array of `{ heading: string, body: string }` sections and renders them in a left-side slide-in panel.\n2. **Trigger mechanisms:** The help panel can be opened via an on-screen help button (e.g. \"?\" icon) and a keyboard shortcut (e.g. H or ?), and dismissed via a close button, the same keyboard shortcut, or clicking outside the panel.\n3. **Scrollable content:** If the rules content exceeds the panel height, the panel supports vertical scrolling with a visible scroll indicator.\n4. **Percentage-based width:** The panel width is responsive, taking a percentage of the game canvas (e.g. 30-40%) rather than a fixed pixel width.\n5. **Golf integration:** The 9-Card Golf example game integrates the help panel with sections covering rules overview, turn flow, scoring, and basic how-to-play instructions. The help panel is accessible during gameplay without pausing the game.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **No game pausing:** The game continues running while the help panel is open. Game input behind the panel may be blocked (to prevent accidental clicks) but AI turns and animations are not frozen.\n- **Engine-level component:** The `HelpPanel` must live in `src/ui/` and be importable via the `@ui/*` path alias. Game-specific content must not be hard-coded in the engine component.\n- **Golf only (initial scope):** Only the 9-Card Golf game needs to integrate the help panel in this work item. Other games will adopt it later.\n- **Content is not interactive:** The help panel displays static text sections. Interactive tutorials, animated demos, or step-by-step walkthroughs are out of scope.\n- **Phaser 3.90.0 compatibility:** The component must work with the current Phaser version and use Phaser's built-in text rendering and input systems (no DOM overlays or external UI libraries).\n- **Quality gates:** `npm test` and `npm run build` must pass after implementation.\n\n## Existing State\n\n- **`src/ui/` module:** Empty stub exporting only `UI_VERSION = '0.1.0'`. No reusable UI components exist.\n- **End-screen overlay in GolfScene (lines 618-674):** The only overlay-like pattern in the codebase -- a semi-transparent rectangle with text and an interactive button. Hard-coded in the scene, not extracted. This serves as a reference for how overlays can be built in Phaser.\n- **Instruction text in GolfScene:** A single-line contextual instruction text at the bottom of the screen that changes per turn phase. Not a help screen.\n- **Rules in code only:** `GolfRules.ts` and `GolfScoring.ts` contain complete rules as JSDoc comments and imperative code, but no player-facing text or data structure exists for rules content.\n- **No keyboard shortcut handling:** The Golf game uses only mouse/pointer input. No keyboard shortcuts are implemented.\n\n## Desired Change\n\n- **New engine component (`src/ui/HelpPanel.ts` or similar):**\n  - Accepts a configuration object with an array of `{ heading: string, body: string }` content sections.\n  - Renders a left-side panel that slides in/out with an animation.\n  - Panel width is percentage-based (e.g. 30-40% of canvas width).\n  - Includes a close button (e.g. \"X\" in the top-right corner of the panel).\n  - Supports vertical scrolling with a scroll indicator when content overflows.\n  - Provides a semi-transparent backdrop behind the panel (optional, to dim the game).\n\n- **Help button (`src/ui/HelpButton.ts` or similar):**\n  - A small on-screen button (e.g. \"?\" icon) that can be placed in a game scene to toggle the help panel.\n  - Reusable across games.\n\n- **Keyboard shortcut support:**\n  - The help panel listens for a configurable keyboard shortcut (default: H or ?) to toggle open/close.\n  - Clicking outside the panel also dismisses it.\n\n- **Golf game integration (`example-games/golf/`):**\n  - Define rules content as an array of sections (e.g. Overview, Turn Flow, Scoring, Tips).\n  - Add the help button to the GolfScene.\n  - Wire up the keyboard shortcut.\n\n- **Tests:**\n  - Unit tests for the HelpPanel component (content rendering, open/close state).\n  - Integration verification that the Golf game's help content loads correctly.\n\n- **Barrel exports:** Update `src/ui/index.ts` to export `HelpPanel`, `HelpButton`, and related types.\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n### Risks\n- **Phaser text scrolling limitations:** Phaser 3 does not have a native scrollable text container. Implementing smooth scrolling with a scroll indicator may require a masked container with drag/wheel input, adding complexity. Mitigation: research Phaser community patterns for scrollable panels before implementation; consider a crop-mask approach with pointer-drag and mouse-wheel listeners.\n- **Input blocking complexity:** Blocking game input behind the panel while keeping the game running (AI turns, animations) may require careful Phaser input priority management. Mitigation: use Phaser's input hit area and depth sorting; test with active AI turns.\n- **First `src/ui/` component sets precedent:** This is the first real component in the engine's UI module. Design decisions (API patterns, naming conventions, configuration approach) will influence all future UI components. Mitigation: keep the API surface minimal and well-documented; review before merging.\n- **Content authoring effort underestimated:** Writing clear, concise player-facing rules text for Golf is a distinct task from building the UI component. Poor rules text undermines the feature even if the component works perfectly. Mitigation: draft rules content early and review for clarity before final integration.\n\n### Assumptions\n- Phaser 3.90.0's mask and input systems are sufficient for implementing a scrollable side panel without external libraries.\n- A single keyboard shortcut (H key) is sufficient; no conflict with existing game input is expected since Golf currently uses only pointer input.\n- Game-specific content will be plain text only (no rich formatting, images, or HTML). Markdown or styled text can be considered in future iterations.\n- The panel does not need to persist state (e.g. scroll position) across open/close cycles.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)** [completed]: The parent spike. The Golf game is the first integration target for this help screen feature.\n- **Golf Phaser UI (CG-0MLSPJ9EW1WGHKLX)** [completed]: Established the Phaser scene patterns (overlays, text rendering, input handling) used in GolfScene. The help panel should follow similar patterns.\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** [open]: Future game spike that will benefit from the reusable help panel.\n- **Future game spikes** (Sushi Go!, Splendor, Lost Cities, The Mind, Coloretto): All will consume the help panel component once built.\n- **`src/ui/index.ts`**: Stub module that will be populated by this work item.\n- **`example-games/golf/scenes/GolfScene.ts`**: Scene that will integrate the help panel.\n- **`example-games/golf/GolfRules.ts`**, **`GolfScoring.ts`**: Source material for the Golf game's help content sections.\n\n## Related work (automated report)\n\nSearched Worklog (keywords: help, panel, UI, overlay, scroll, button, keyboard, rules, instructions, Golf) and repository files. Conservative filtering applied -- only items with clear relevance to the help panel feature are included.\n\n### Worklog items\n\n- **Golf Phaser UI (CG-0MLSPJ9EW1WGHKLX)** [completed]: The most directly relevant prior work. GolfScene.ts (lines 618-674) contains the only overlay pattern in the codebase -- a semi-transparent rectangle with text and an interactive button for the end-of-round screen. This serves as the primary reference implementation for how to build overlay/panel UI in Phaser within this project, including depth management, text rendering, and interactive button patterns.\n\n- **Golf Game Rules and Scoring (CG-0MLSPI9YQ083H8LO)** [completed]: Implemented the game rules (GolfRules.ts) and scoring logic (GolfScoring.ts) that contain the authoritative rule definitions as JSDoc comments and code. These files are the source material from which player-facing help content sections (rules overview, turn flow, scoring) must be derived. No player-facing text data structure exists yet -- this work item must create one.\n\n- **Investigate and fix broken Golf UI interactions (CG-0MLSW8TKZ0YHXJR2)** [completed]: Fixed interaction handling in GolfScene (click handling, turn flow, AI execution, state transitions). Understanding these fixes is relevant because the help panel must coexist with the game's input handling -- blocking game clicks behind the panel while keeping AI turns and animations running requires awareness of the current input architecture.\n\n- **Phaser UI Browser Testing with Vitest (CG-0MLSUJIE30K54IUO)** [completed]: Established browser-mode testing infrastructure using Vitest + Playwright. The help panel's unit and integration tests should follow the same patterns (*.browser.test.ts convention, window.__PHASER_GAME__ access for state assertions) to verify rendering and interaction in a real browser.\n\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** [open, idea stage]: The next planned game spike. Will be the second consumer of the reusable HelpPanel component, validating that the API is truly game-agnostic. The help panel's content section interface ({ heading, body }) should be validated against this game's anticipated content needs.\n\n- **Scaffold Card Game Engine project (CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH)** [completed]: Established the src/ui/ module stub and the @ui/* path alias. The HelpPanel and HelpButton components must be exported from src/ui/index.ts and importable via @ui/* per the project conventions set by this work item.\n\n### Repository files\n\n- **`src/ui/index.ts`**: Currently an empty stub exporting only `UI_VERSION = '0.1.0'`. This is where HelpPanel, HelpButton, and related types must be exported. As the first real component added to this module, the API design here sets a precedent for all future UI components.\n\n- **`example-games/golf/scenes/GolfScene.ts`** (676 lines): The integration target scene. The end-screen overlay (lines 618-674) demonstrates the overlay pattern (semi-transparent background rectangle, centered text, interactive button with hover states, depth management). The help panel implementation should follow this pattern but extract it into a reusable, configurable component rather than hard-coding it in the scene.\n\n- **`example-games/golf/GolfRules.ts`**: Contains complete turn flow rules as JSDoc (draw from stock/discard, swap or discard+flip, round ending detection, initial reveal). The help content's \"Turn Flow\" and \"How to Play\" sections should be derived from these documented rules.\n\n- **`example-games/golf/GolfScoring.ts`**: Contains scoring rules as JSDoc (A=1, 2=-2, 3-10=face, J/Q=10, K=0, column-of-three=0). The help content's \"Scoring\" section should be derived from this documented logic.\n\n- **`example-games/golf/GolfGrid.ts`**: Defines the 3x3 grid model (GRID_ROWS=3, GRID_COLS=3) used by the game. Relevant context for writing the help content's rules overview section explaining the grid layout.","effort":"","id":"CG-0MLT0PM000TQRIXT","issueType":"feature","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":null,"priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":1400,"stage":"done","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Help Screen with Game Rules and Instructions","updatedAt":"2026-02-19T11:20:09.114Z"},"type":"workitem"}

This is because the GeometryMask is drawn at the container's x position at the time of opening (which is off-screen at -panelWidth), and is never updated during the slide-in animation.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn resetScroll() (called by open()), the mask is drawn at maskX = this.container.x, which is -panelWidth (off-screen). The slide-in tween animates container.x from -panelWidth to 0, but the mask rectangle is not redrawn during the animation.

No deployment pipeline or public hosting exists; players and stakeholders must clone the repo and run a local dev server to try the games.\n\n## Users\n\n- **Player / stakeholder (primary):** Wants to play the card games immediately in a browser without any local setup.\n  - *\"As a player, I want to visit a URL and choose from available card games so I can play them immediately without installing anything.\"*\n\n- **Project maintainer (secondary):** Wants every merge to `main` to automatically publish the latest version of the games.\n  - *\"As a maintainer, I want pushes to main to automatically deploy the site so that the published games always reflect the latest state of the code.\"*\n\n- **Contributor (tertiary):** Wants confidence that only passing builds are deployed.\n  - *\"As a contributor, I want the deploy pipeline to run tests and build checks before deploying so that broken code never reaches the live site.\"*\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. **Live URL:** Visiting the default GitHub Pages URL (`<user>.github.io/<repo>/`) displays the Game Selector landing page with tiles for 9-Card Golf and Beleaguered Castle.\n2. **Automated deployment:** A GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and deploys the site whenever code is pushed or merged to the `main` branch.\n3. **Quality gates enforced:** The workflow runs `npm test` and `npm run build` before deploying; deployment is skipped if either step fails.\n4. **Games are playable:** Both 9-Card Golf and Beleaguered Castle are fully playable from the deployed site with all existing functionality intact (input, animations, help panels, scoring, etc.).\n5. **Correct asset paths:** All card SVG assets, fonts, and other static resources load correctly under the GitHub Pages sub-path (`/<repo>/`).\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **GitHub Pages only:** The hosting platform is GitHub Pages using the default URL (`<user>.github.io/<repo>/`). No custom domain.\n- **Blocked by Game Selector (CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4):** The deployment depends on the Game Selector Index Page being completed first, since the deployed site needs a landing page to navigate between games.\n- **Deploy pipeline scope only:** This work item covers only the GitHub Actions workflow and Vite configuration changes needed for deployment. It does not include PR CI checks, status badges, monitoring, analytics, or error tracking.\n- **No Hello World game:** The Hello World example is excluded from the deployed site since it is a toolchain proof, not a playable game.\n- **Quality gates:** The project's existing quality gates (`npm test` and `npm run build`) must pass before deployment proceeds.\n- **Licensing:** All deployment tooling and configuration must be compatible with the project's open-source licensing requirements.\n\n## Existing State\n\n- **No CI/CD:** No `.github/` directory, no GitHub Actions workflows, no deployment automation of any kind.\n- **No hosting configuration:** No references to gh-pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting in project files. No `gh-pages` npm package.\n- **Vite base path not set:** `vite.config.ts` does not configure a `base` path, defaulting to `/`. This is incompatible with GitHub Pages sub-path hosting (`/<repo>/`).\n- **No deploy scripts:** `package.json` has no deploy-related scripts.\n- **Single hard-coded entry point:** `index.html` is hard-coded to load the Golf game (`/example-games/golf/main.ts`). There is no landing page or game selector.\n- **Three example games exist:** hello-world (toolchain proof), 9-Card Golf (playable), Beleaguered Castle (playable). Only Golf and Beleaguered Castle are in scope for deployment.\n- **Game Selector in progress:** CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4 is in-progress on a feature branch but has no commits yet. This deployment epic is blocked until it is completed.\n\n## Desired Change\n\n- **Vite `base` path configuration:** Set `base` in `vite.config.ts` to the repository name (e.g., `/<repo>/`) so that all asset paths resolve correctly on GitHub Pages. This may need to be configurable (e.g., via environment variable) to avoid breaking local development.\n- **GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` or similar):**\n  - Triggered on push to `main` branch.\n  - Steps: checkout, install dependencies, run `npm test`, run `npm run build`, deploy `dist/` to GitHub Pages.\n  - Uses the official `actions/deploy-pages` action (or `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` or similar well-maintained action).\n- **GitHub Pages configuration:** Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings to serve from the GitHub Actions deployment source. This is a manual step in the GitHub repository settings UI (Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions).\n- **Documentation updates:** Update `docs/DEVELOPER.md` and `AGENTS.md` to document the deployment pipeline, the GitHub Pages URL, and the Vite base path configuration.\n- **Landing page integration:** The deployed site serves the Game Selector (from CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4) as the root page, allowing users to choose between 9-Card Golf and Beleaguered Castle.\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n### Risks\n- **Vite base path may break local dev:** Changing the Vite `base` to `/<repo>/` could break the local dev server (which expects `/`). Mitigation: use a conditional `base` configuration (e.g., set `base` only for production builds via an environment variable or Vite's `mode`).\n- **GitHub Pages caching:** GitHub Pages may aggressively cache assets, causing stale versions to be served after a deploy. Mitigation: Vite's production build uses content-hashed filenames by default, which avoids this for JS/CSS bundles. Verify SVG and other static assets are also handled correctly.\n- **Phaser canvas/WebGL on GitHub Pages:** Phaser's WebGL renderer should work on GitHub Pages (it's just static files), but sub-path asset loading issues could cause blank screens or missing card graphics. Mitigation: test the production build locally with `npm run preview` using the correct base path before the first deploy.\n- **SPA routing on GitHub Pages:** GitHub Pages serves static files and returns 404 for unknown paths. If the Game Selector uses client-side routing (e.g., `/<repo>/golf`), direct navigation or page refresh on a game URL will 404. Mitigation: verify the Game Selector's routing approach is compatible with static hosting (hash-based routing, or a 404.html fallback).\n- **Scope creep into broader CI/CD:** There may be pressure to add PR checks, linting, status badges, or other CI features during this work. Mitigation: record these as separate work items linked to this epic rather than expanding scope.\n- **Game Selector dependency delay:** If the Game Selector (CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4) takes longer than expected, this deployment work will be blocked. Mitigation: the deployment pipeline (workflow, Vite config) can be built and tested independently of the game selector; only the final integration requires it.\n\n### Assumptions\n- The GitHub repository has GitHub Pages available (it is a public repo or the account has Pages enabled for private repos).\n- The `actions/deploy-pages` (or equivalent) GitHub Action is freely available and well-maintained.\n- Vite's production build output (`dist/`) is a self-contained static site suitable for GitHub Pages without server-side processing.\n- The Game Selector (CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4) will produce a single-page application with client-side routing (or direct links) to each game, compatible with GitHub Pages' static file serving model.\n- No server-side features (APIs, databases, authentication) are required for the deployed games.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **Game Selector Index Page (CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4)** [in-progress]: Prerequisite. This deployment epic is blocked until the game selector landing page is completed. The selector provides the entry point for the deployed site.\n- **9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)** [completed]: First playable game to be included in the deployed site.\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** [completed]: Second playable game to be included in the deployed site.\n- **Scaffold Card Game Engine project (CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH)** [completed]: Established the Vite build pipeline and project structure. The deployment work builds on top of this foundation.\n- **Add pre-commit hook to enforce doc updates (CG-0MLSHQMDY1H0I2B7)** [open]: The deployment workflow changes must include documentation updates per the doc-update policy.\n- **`vite.config.ts`**: Build configuration that needs `base` path changes.\n- **`package.json`**: May need a deploy script or updated build configuration.\n- **`index.html`**: Current hard-coded entry point that will be replaced by the game selector.\n- **`docs/DEVELOPER.md`**: Must be updated with deployment documentation.\n\n## Suggested Next Step\n\nOnce the Game Selector (CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4) is completed, break this epic into child work items: (1) Vite base path configuration, (2) GitHub Actions deploy workflow, (3) GitHub Pages repository settings configuration (manual), (4) documentation updates for `docs/DEVELOPER.md` and `AGENTS.md`, (5) end-to-end deployment verification. Implementation can begin on items 1-2 in parallel with the game selector if desired, with final integration and verification after the selector is merged.\n\n**Dependency:** This epic is blocked by Game Selector Index Page (CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4). Track with `blocked-by:CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4`.\n\n## Related work (automated report)\n\nSearched Worklog (keywords: deploy, github, pages, hosting, build, vite, workflow, game selector, CI/CD, base path) and repository files. Conservative filtering applied -- only items with clear relevance to deployment, hosting, or build configuration are included.\n\n### Worklog items\n\n- **Game Selector Index Page (CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4)** [completed]: The landing page that provides navigation between games. This is the direct prerequisite for deployment -- the deployed site uses this as its root page. Now completed, unblocking this deployment epic.\n\n- **Scaffold Card Game Engine project (CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH)** [completed]: Established the Vite 6.1 + TypeScript 5.7 build pipeline, `package.json` scripts (`dev`, `build`, `test`, `preview`), and the project's directory structure. The deployment workflow will invoke the same `npm test` and `npm run build` commands set up by this scaffold. The `vite.config.ts` created here needs `base` path modification for GitHub Pages.\n\n- **Package.json, Vite, and TypeScript Config (CG-0MLSGNJUD0F48DHV)** [completed]: Child of the scaffold epic that created the specific build configuration files (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`). The deployment work directly modifies `vite.config.ts` (adding `base` path) and may add a deploy script to `package.json`.\n\n- **Add pre-commit hook to enforce doc updates (CG-0MLSHQMDY1H0I2B7)** [open]: The doc-update policy requires that any infrastructure change (including new CI/CD workflows and build config changes) includes corresponding documentation updates. This deployment epic must comply by updating `docs/DEVELOPER.md` and `AGENTS.md`.\n\n- **Add README and Developer Docs (CG-0MLSHQJIU0097VRY)** [completed]: Created `docs/DEVELOPER.md` which documents build/test commands and the manual game-switching process. The deployment epic must update this file to document the GitHub Pages URL, the deployment pipeline, and the Vite base path configuration.\n\n### Repository files\n\n- **`vite.config.ts`**: The primary build configuration file. Currently has no `base` path set (defaults to `/`). Must be modified to set `base` conditionally for production builds to support GitHub Pages sub-path hosting (`/<repo>/`).\n\n- **`package.json`**: Defines `dev`, `build`, `test`, and `preview` scripts. The deployment workflow will invoke `npm test` and `npm run build`. May need a convenience deploy script added.\n\n- **`index.html`**: The single HTML entry point for Vite. Currently hard-codes the Golf game import; the Game Selector (now completed) should have updated this to load the game selector instead.\n\n- **`docs/DEVELOPER.md`**: Developer documentation that currently describes manual game switching and local development. Must be updated with deployment documentation (GitHub Pages URL, pipeline description, base path explanation).\n\n- **`AGENTS.md`**: Project rules and architecture document. References that \"multi-game routing will be added as more games are implemented.\" Must be updated to reflect the deployed site and deployment pipeline per the doc-update policy.","effort":"","id":"CG-0MLTRXRKK1Q50Z0M","issueType":"epic","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":null,"priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":1800,"stage":"plan_complete","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Deploy card games to GitHub Pages","updatedAt":"2026-02-19T23:15:31.241Z"},"type":"workitem"}

This increases maintenance cost, creates subtle bugs, and makes cross-game tooling harder. We need to refactor and consolidate those components into the engine's `src/` modules and update consumers.\n\nUsers\n- Engine developers: want stable, well-documented modules they can reuse across spikes. \"As an engine developer, I can import `@card-system` and rely on tested Card/Deck/Pile behavior so new game spikes focus on gameplay not plumbing.\" \n- Example-game authors: want minimal friction migrating to engine APIs. \"As a game author, I can update a few imports and run tests to validate my game after the refactor.\"\n- QA/test engineers: want reproducible behaviour and test coverage. \"As QA I can run `npm test` and confirm no regressions across example-games after extraction.\"\n\nSuccess criteria\n1. Card system extraction: `src/card-system` becomes the single canonical implementation (Card, Deck, Pile, index barrel) with new unit tests covering exported behaviour. Example games (Golf, Beleaguered Castle) update imports and pass their tests.\n2. Core engine stabilization: `TurnSequencer` and minimal core APIs are refactored as needed, exported from `src/core-engine`, with unit tests and at least one updated consumer integration test passing.\n3. All example-games compile and all existing tests (unit + browser tests) pass (`npm test`) after the refactor and consumer updates.\n4. Barrel exports and path aliases remain consistent; developer docs updated (`docs/DEVELOPER.md`) with migration notes and examples.\n5. No runtime regressions in CI: `npm run build` and `npm test` succeed in CI/local environment.\n\nConstraints\n- Policy chosen: allow breaking changes during the refactor and update all example-game consumers in the same sweep (per product decision). This increases scope and requires careful branch/PR coordination.\n- All changes must be accompanied by unit tests for exported behaviour and updated consumer tests.\n- Keep changes minimal and conservative where possible; where intent is unclear add clarifying questions rather than guessing.\n- Ensure `npm test` and `npm run build` succeed before committing; do not push failing branches.\n\nExisting state\n- `src/card-system/` currently exists (`Card.ts`, `Deck.ts`, `Pile.ts`, `index.ts`) and is already imported by `example-games/golf` and `example-games/beleaguered-castle`.\n- `src/core-engine/TurnSequencer.ts` exists and is used by games, but may need API adjustments.\n- Several unit and browser tests exist for card-system and games (`tests/card-system/*`, `tests/golf/*`) — these provide a baseline for expected behaviour and regression checks.\n- Worklog context: this item `CG-0MLTSPOK705155TZ` was created and set to in-progress; related work items include the scaffold (CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH) and replay tooling (CG-0MLSN2YWY1EL17FN).\n\nDesired change\n- Extract and stabilize common modules under `src/` with clear barrel exports and TypeScript types: at minimum `src/card-system`, `src/core-engine` (APIs to be hardened), `src/ui/helpers`, and `src/scoring` or `src/ai` as needed.\n- Update all example-game consumers to align with the new/updated APIs (imports, type usages, minor API adjustments).

In-game buttons during active gameplay (Menu, Undo, Redo) work correctly, and card interactions (drag-and-drop, click-to-move) also function as expected. The issue is isolated to buttons created on the end-game/game-over overlay screens. After a game ends, the player's only option to start a new game is to refresh the browser page.\n\n## Users\n\n- **Player:** Cannot restart a completed game or navigate back to the game selector menu after a game finishes. Must refresh the browser to play again.\n  - *\"As a player, I want the restart and menu buttons on the game-over screen to respond when I click them so I can start a new game or return to the game selector without refreshing the browser.\"*\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. Golf end screen buttons respond to clicks: \"[ Play Again ]\" starts a new game; \"[ Menu ]\" returns to the game selector.\n2. Beleaguered Castle win overlay buttons respond to clicks: \"[ New Game ]\" starts a new random deal; \"[ Restart ]\" replays the same deal; \"[ Menu ]\" returns to the game selector.\n3. Beleaguered Castle no-moves overlay buttons respond to clicks: \"[ Undo Last ]\" dismisses the overlay and undoes the last move; \"[ New Game ]\", \"[ Restart ]\", and \"[ Menu ]\" work as on the win overlay.\n4. In-game buttons (Menu, Undo, Redo) continue to work correctly (no regression).\n5. Card drag-and-drop and click-to-move interactions continue to work correctly (no regression).\n6. All existing tests pass (`npm test`) and build succeeds (`npm run build`).\n\n## Constraints\n\n- The fix must not break in-game buttons, card drag-and-drop, or click-to-move interactions which currently work.\n- Both games must be fixed.\n- No new dependencies should be required; this is a bug in existing code, not a missing feature.\n\n## Existing State\n\n- **Golf end screen** (`example-games/golf/scenes/GolfScene.ts:671-742`): Creates \"[ Play Again ]\" and \"[ Menu ]\" text buttons on a semi-transparent overlay rectangle. Buttons are created with `this.add.text(...).setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true })` and `pointerdown` event handlers. \"Play Again\" calls `this.scene.restart()`, \"Menu\" calls `this.scene.start('GameSelectorScene')`. Overlay rectangle is at depth 10, text at depth 11.\n- **Beleaguered Castle overlays** (`example-games/beleaguered-castle/scenes/BeleagueredCastleScene.ts:1056-1237`): Creates buttons via `createOverlayButton()` helper (lines 1209-1227) inside a Phaser container at depth 2000. Win overlay has 3 buttons, no-moves overlay has 4 buttons. All buttons use the same `setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true })` pattern.\n- **In-game buttons work:** The \"[ Menu ]\" button, undo/redo buttons, and other HUD elements created during `create()` respond correctly during gameplay, confirming that text `setInteractive()` works in general.\n- **Card interactions work:** Phaser's drag system and sprite click interactions function correctly.\n- **Prior fix (CG-0MLSW8TKZ0YHXJR2):** A UI interaction bug was previously fixed in the Golf game (commit f251bff, merge 7a007bc). That fix addressed layout/sizing issues.\n\n## Desired Change\n\nDiagnose and fix why text buttons on game-over overlay screens do not receive pointer events. Since in-game buttons work but overlay buttons do not, the root cause is likely related to how the overlay is constructed or how buttons interact with other game objects at game-end time.\n\nLikely causes to investigate:\n- **Depth/z-ordering conflict:** The overlay background rectangle or other game objects created at game-end time may be at a higher depth than the buttons, intercepting clicks. In Golf, the overlay rectangle is at depth 10 and text is at depth 11 (these are standalone objects, not in a container). In Beleaguered Castle, buttons are inside a container at depth 2000 -- container children inherit the container's depth for input.\n- **Input-blocking game objects:** The `gameEnded` flag or `interactionBlocked` getter in Beleaguered Castle (line 231) may be suppressing input globally, including overlay buttons. In Golf, the `interactionBlocked` equivalent may prevent overlay button events.\n- **Container input passthrough:** In Beleaguered Castle, overlay buttons are added to a Phaser Container. If the container doesn't have proper input setup, child interactive objects may not receive events.\n- **Hit area sizing:** Text objects may have zero-size or stale hit areas if the text content hasn't been measured by the time `setInteractive()` is called (Phaser quirk with text rendering timing).\n- **Overlay rectangle consuming input:** The semi-transparent background rectangles may have been made interactive (explicitly or by default) and are consuming pointer events before they reach the buttons.\n\nAfter fixing, consider adding automated browser tests that verify end-game overlay button clicks to prevent future regressions.\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n### Risks\n- **Different root causes per game:** Although the symptom is identical, Golf uses standalone depth-ordered objects while Beleaguered Castle uses a container-based overlay. The root cause could differ between games, requiring separate fixes.\n- **Regression risk:** Changes to depth ordering or input handling could affect in-game button or card interaction behavior.\n- **Test coverage gap:** No existing automated tests exercise end-game overlay button clicks. Without new regression tests, this bug class could recur.\n- **Input-blocking guard as root cause:** Both games have `interactionBlocked` / guard checks that prevent input during certain states. If the game-end state sets these guards before overlay buttons are created, overlay buttons would inherit the blocked state. This is a high-probability root cause.\n\n### Assumptions\n- The issue is in the game code (overlay construction, depth ordering, input blocking logic), not in Phaser 3.90.0 itself.\n- In-game buttons working correctly during gameplay confirms the Phaser input system is fundamentally operational.\n- The issue is always reproducible and not browser-specific.\n- The fix will be straightforward once the root cause (likely depth/input-blocking) is identified.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **Investigate and fix broken Golf UI interactions (CG-0MLSW8TKZ0YHXJR2)** [completed]: Previous UI fix for the Golf game (commit f251bff, merge 7a007bc). Fixed layout/sizing issues. The overlay buttons may have been introduced or modified after this fix.\n- **Win/Loss, New Game, Restart, Scoring (CG-0MLTFF2R70UXJD2T)** [completed]: Implemented the Beleaguered Castle game-over overlays and restart/new-game buttons (commit faa5631, merge 18c373e). This is where the Beleaguered Castle overlay button code was introduced.\n- **Golf Phaser UI (CG-0MLSPJ9EW1WGHKLX)** [completed]: Original implementation of the Golf scene including end screen buttons.\n- **Phaser UI Browser Testing with Vitest (CG-0MLSUJIE30K54IUO)** [completed]: Browser test infrastructure that could be extended with end-game overlay button-click regression tests.\n- **Refactor common components from games into game engine (CG-0MLTSPOK705155TZ)** [open]: Related work to extract shared UI patterns (including overlay buttons) into reusable components. Fixing the button issue first is prerequisite.\n- **Game Selector Index Page (CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4)** [completed]: The menu navigation target for \"[ Menu ]\" buttons.\n\n\n## Related work (automated report)\n\nSearched Worklog (68 items, keywords: game-over, overlay, button, unresponsive, restart, input, interactive, pointer, depth, setInteractive, interactionBlocked, gameEnded) and repository files. The following items have clear, direct relevance to the game-over button unresponsiveness bug.\n\n### Worklog items\n\n- **Investigate and fix broken Golf UI interactions (CG-0MLSW8TKZ0YHXJR2)** [completed]: The most directly relevant prior fix. Addressed broken Golf UI layout and click handling (commit f251bff, merge 7a007bc) by resizing cards and recalculating layout positions. The fix focused on in-game interactions rather than end-screen overlays, so overlay buttons may not have been tested after those layout changes. The same class of problem (pointer events not reaching targets) recurs here in the overlay context.\n\n- **Win/Loss, New Game, Restart, Scoring (CG-0MLTFF2R70UXJD2T)** [completed]: Introduced the Beleaguered Castle game-over overlay code (commit faa5631, merge 18c373e), including the `gameEnded` flag, `interactionBlocked` getter, `showWinOverlay()`, `showNoMovesOverlay()`, and `createOverlayButton()`. This is the origin of the Beleaguered Castle side of the bug. The `interactionBlocked` getter returns `true` when `gameEnded` is `true` (line 232), which gates all card and drag interaction handlers -- but overlay button handlers are separate and should not be affected unless the overlay is constructed before buttons are interactive.\n\n- **Golf Phaser UI (CG-0MLSPJ9EW1WGHKLX)** [completed]: Original implementation of the Golf scene including the `showEndScreen()` method (lines 671-742). The end screen creates a depth-10 overlay rectangle and depth-11 text buttons as standalone objects (not in a container). The overlay rectangle is not explicitly made interactive, but Phaser may still intercept pointer events on it if its hit area overlaps the buttons.\n\n- **Phaser UI Browser Testing with Vitest (CG-0MLSUJIE30K54IUO)** [completed]: Established the Playwright + Vitest browser test infrastructure (headless Chromium, `*.browser.test.ts` convention). Existing browser tests cover in-game interactions but do not exercise end-game overlay buttons. This infrastructure should be extended with regression tests for overlay button clicks as part of the fix.\n\n- **Game Selector Index Page (CG-0MLTRTAWY0X0CSY4)** [completed]: Added `[ Menu ]` buttons to both game scenes (commit 40ca574, merge 7f315fb), including overlay menu buttons. The menu button is the navigation target for overlay `[ Menu ]` buttons (`this.scene.start('GameSelectorScene')`). Relevant because the Menu button implementation in overlays was added/modified in this work item.\n\n- **Refactor common components from games into game engine (CG-0MLTSPOK705155TZ)** [open]: Plans to extract shared UI patterns including overlay buttons into reusable engine components. Fixing the overlay button bug is a prerequisite for this extraction -- the extracted component must work correctly.\n\n- **In-Game Transcript Export Button (CG-0MLTFRU211Y0Z2WU)** [open]: Plans to add an \"Export Transcript\" button to the end-of-round results screen. This feature depends on overlay buttons being functional, as the export button would be added to the same overlay that is currently unresponsive.\n\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** [completed]: Parent epic for the Beleaguered Castle game. The `interactionBlocked` guard pattern (line 231) and `gameEnded` flag (line 208) were introduced across multiple child features. Understanding how these flags interact with overlay button input is key to diagnosing the Beleaguered Castle side of the bug.\n\n### Repository files\n\n- **`example-games/golf/scenes/GolfScene.ts`** (lines 671-742): Contains `showEndScreen()` which creates the Golf end-game overlay. Overlay rectangle at depth 10, text buttons at depth 11. Buttons use `setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true })` with `pointerdown` handlers. The overlay rectangle is not explicitly interactive but may block input. Key code for diagnosing the Golf side of the bug.\n\n- **`example-games/beleaguered-castle/scenes/BeleagueredCastleScene.ts`** (lines 1056-1237): Contains `showWinOverlay()`, `showNoMovesOverlay()`, and `createOverlayButton()`. Overlay buttons are inside a Phaser Container at depth 2000. The `interactionBlocked` getter (line 231) returns `true` when `gameEnded` is `true`, gating all card/drag handlers (lines 479, 507, 520, 539, 752, 776, 807, 907, 917). However, overlay button `pointerdown` handlers are registered directly on text objects and do not check `interactionBlocked` -- so the guard should not block them unless Phaser's container input system is involved.\n\n- **`example-games/beleaguered-castle/scenes/BeleagueredCastleScene.ts`** (line 208, 231-232): The `gameEnded` boolean and `interactionBlocked` getter. When `gameEnded` is set to `true` (lines 940, 951, 1025), `interactionBlocked` returns `true`, blocking card interactions. The overlays are shown after `gameEnded` is set. If `interactionBlocked` inadvertently blocks overlay button input (e.g., through a global input check), this is likely the root cause for Beleaguered Castle.\n\n- **`src/ui/HelpPanel.ts`** (line 432): Uses `this.inputBlocker.setInteractive()` to create an input-blocking overlay. This is a working example of an interactive overlay that intentionally blocks input behind it. The game-over overlays may need a similar pattern but currently lack it, or conversely, the HelpPanel's input blocker may be interfering.\n\n- **`src/ui/GameSelectorScene.ts`** (line 157): Uses `setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true })` for game card buttons on the selector page. These buttons work correctly, confirming the pattern is valid when no input-blocking guards are active.","effort":"","id":"CG-0MLTSYKYU11LEUWX","issueType":"bug","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":null,"priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":2000,"stage":"in_progress","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Game-over screen buttons unresponsive in all games","updatedAt":"2026-02-19T20:34:05.787Z"},"type":"workitem"}

The same issue affects both the swap and discard-and-flip move types.\n\n## Users\n\n- **Player (primary):** Plays Golf in the browser and needs clear visual feedback about what is happening during card swaps and flips.\n  - *\"As a player, I want to see the grid card flip to reveal its face and then move to the discard pile while the drawn card slides into the grid slot, so I can clearly understand what just happened.\"*\n\n- **Engine developer:** Maintains the GolfScene animation code and needs it to be clear, maintainable, and consistent across move types.\n  - *\"As a developer, I want the animation logic for swap and discard-and-flip to be clearly structured so I can extend or adjust timings without confusion.\"*\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. **Swap animation:** When a swap move occurs, the grid card flips (revealing its face) while simultaneously moving to the discard pile, and the drawn card simultaneously animates from its display position into the now-vacated grid slot.\n2. **Discard-and-flip animation:** When a discard-and-flip move occurs, the drawn card animates from its display position to the discard pile, then the selected face-down grid card flips in place to reveal itself.\n3. **Both players:** The improved animations play for both human and AI turns.\n4. **No regressions:** All existing unit and browser tests pass (`npm test`), and `npm run build` succeeds.\n5. **Playable:** A complete round of Golf can be played from start to finish in the browser without animation glitches or unhandled errors.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- Scope is limited to the card swap/flip animation fix. No other visual polish or feature changes are included.\n- Animations must use Phaser tweens (the existing animation framework in the project).\n- The fix must work for both human and AI player turns.\n- Card asset dimensions remain 140x190px.\n\n## Existing State\n\nThe animation code lives in `GolfScene.ts:588-636` in the `animateTurn()` method. Currently:\n\n- **Swap move:** The grid card sprite scales X to 0 (half-flip), then its texture is changed to the incoming drawn card, then it scales X back to 1. The old grid card texture is replaced in-place — there is no movement animation of either card.\n- **Discard-and-flip move:** Identical animation to swap — the grid card flips and its texture changes. No visual movement of the drawn card to the discard pile.\n- The drawn card display is handled by `showDrawnCard()` (line 641) and `hideDrawnCard()` (line 660), which create/destroy a sprite near the discard pile.\n\n## Desired Change\n\nModify the `animateTurn()` method in `GolfScene.ts` to implement two distinct animation sequences:\n\n### Swap move\n1. The grid card begins a flip animation (scale X 0→1 with texture change to reveal its actual face) while simultaneously translating from the grid slot position toward the discard pile position.\n2. At the same time, the drawn card sprite translates from its display position (right of discard pile) into the grid slot position.\n3. Both movements happen simultaneously (parallel tweens).\n4. On completion, update the discard pile visual and refresh the grid.\n\n### Discard-and-flip move\n1. The drawn card sprite animates from its display position to the discard pile position.\n2. After that animation completes, the selected face-down grid card flips in place (scale X 0→1 with texture change to reveal its face).\n3. On completion, update the discard pile visual and refresh the grid.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **Golf Phaser UI (CG-0MLSPJ9EW1WGHKLX)** [completed]: Original implementation that created the current animation code.\n- **Investigate and fix broken Golf UI interactions (CG-0MLSW8TKZ0YHXJR2)** [completed]: Previous bug fix for Golf UI interactions.\n- **9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)** [completed]: Parent epic for all Golf game work.\n- **Golf Scene Event Integration (CG-0MLTFSPNA1WUN7MS)** [blocked]: Future event-driven scene work that may consume or interact with animation code.\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n### Risks\n- **Animation timing complexity:** Coordinating simultaneous flip + translate + movement tweens may require careful sequencing to avoid visual glitches. Mitigation: test with both fast and slow animation durations; use Phaser's built-in tween chaining/parallel capabilities.\n- **AI turn visibility:** AI turns happen with a delay (`AI_DELAY`); the new longer animations may need timing adjustments so the AI turn doesn't feel too slow or overlap with the next turn. Mitigation: test AI turns visually during development and adjust `AI_DELAY` if needed.\n- **Scope creep:** Improving animations could lead to desire for additional visual polish (particle effects, sound, card arc paths, etc.). Mitigation: record any opportunities for additional features or refinements as separate work items linked via `discovered-from:CG-0MLTW1ZU40CQ7387`, rather than expanding the scope of this item.\n- **Browser test brittleness:** Existing browser tests (`GolfScene.browser.test.ts`, `GolfInteraction.browser.test.ts`, `GolfOverlay.browser.test.ts`) may assert animation timing or sprite positions that break with the new animation sequences. Mitigation: review and update browser tests as part of the implementation.\n\n### Assumptions\n- Phaser 3.90.0's tween system supports running simultaneous translate + scale tweens on different sprites without conflicts.\n- The existing `showDrawnCard()`/`hideDrawnCard()` pattern can be adapted to animate the drawn card sprite to its destination rather than just creating/destroying it.\n- No changes are needed to the game logic (`GolfRules`, `GolfGame`, etc.) — this is purely a visual/animation fix in `GolfScene.ts`.\n- The `hideDrawnCard()` call currently in `humanMove()` (line 510) will need to be deferred or restructured so the drawn card sprite persists long enough to animate.\n\n## Suggested Next Step\n\nProceed directly to implementation — the scope is well-defined and limited primarily to `animateTurn()` in `example-games/golf/scenes/GolfScene.ts`, with minor adjustments to `showDrawnCard()`/`hideDrawnCard()` and the call site in `humanMove()`. No sub-task breakdown is needed.\n\n## Related work (automated report)\n\nSearched Worklog (69 items) and repository files for keywords: animation, animateTurn, swap, flip, tween, GolfScene, discard, showDrawnCard, hideDrawnCard, card movement. The following items have clear, direct relevance to the Golf card swap/flip animation fix.\n\n### Worklog items\n\n- **Show AI draw source with pause before move (CG-0MLTCUK500GZUJ6N)** [completed]: Rewrote `runAiTurn()` in GolfScene.ts to call `showDrawnCard()` for AI turns and added an `AI_SHOW_DRAW_DELAY` pause before executing the AI move. The animation fix in CG-0MLTW1ZU40CQ7387 must restructure `showDrawnCard()`/`hideDrawnCard()` so the drawn card sprite persists long enough to animate to its destination — this directly intersects with the AI draw display logic introduced by this item. Any changes to when `hideDrawnCard()` is called will affect both human and AI turn flows.\n\n- **Golf Scene Event Integration (CG-0MLTFSPNA1WUN7MS)** [completed]: Added lifecycle event emission (`animation-complete`, `state-settled`) into the `animateTurn()` callback chain. The animation fix must preserve the event emission points — specifically, `animation-complete` must fire after the new parallel/sequential tween sequences finish, and `state-settled` must fire after the board visuals are updated. Changing the tween structure without updating event emission will break the replay tool's synchronization.\n\n### Repository files\n\n- **`example-games/golf/scenes/GolfScene.ts`** (lines 611–660): Contains the `animateTurn()` method — the primary target for this fix. Both swap and discard-and-flip branches currently use identical flip-in-place animations (scale X to 0, texture swap, scale X back to 1) with no card movement. Also contains `showDrawnCard()` (line 664) and `hideDrawnCard()` (line 683), which create/destroy the drawn card sprite and must be restructured to support animation.\n\n- **`tests/golf/GolfInteraction.browser.test.ts`**: Browser tests for Golf UI interaction flow (draw, swap, discard). May assert sprite positions or timing assumptions that break with new animation sequences and will need review/updates.\n\n- **`tests/golf/GolfEvents.browser.test.ts`**: Browser tests verifying lifecycle event emission during gameplay. Tests for `animation-complete` and `state-settled` events depend on the animation callback structure that this fix will modify.","effort":"","id":"CG-0MLTW1ZU40CQ7387","issueType":"bug","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":null,"priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":2100,"stage":"in_progress","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Golf animation is confusing","updatedAt":"2026-02-20T01:45:33.393Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Both use setDepth() for layering and setInteractive() on the blocker to prevent click-through. BC uses OVERLAY_DEPTH=2000, Golf uses depth=10.\n\n2. **Styled button creation**: BeleagueredCastleScene has an explicit createOverlayButton(x, y, label, depth) method. GolfScene inlines the same pattern. Both use:\n   - fontSize: '14px', color: '#88ff88', fontFamily: FONT_FAMILY\n   - setOrigin(0.5), setInteractive({ useHandCursor: true })\n   - pointerover -> '#aaffaa', pointerout -> '#88ff88'\n\n3. **Menu button in overlays**: Both scenes create [ Menu ] buttons in their end-game overlays that navigate to GameSelectorScene.\n\n## User Story\n\nAs an engine developer, I want a shared overlay and button system exported from @ui/ so that new game scenes can display modal overlays (win/loss/pause) with consistent styling and behavior without reimplementing the overlay background, input blocking, and button hover patterns.\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n1. Create src/ui/OverlayButton.ts with:\n   - createOverlayButton(scene, x, y, label, depth?, config?): Phaser.GameObjects.Text\n   - Default styling: fontSize 14px, color #88ff88, hover #aaffaa, fontFamily from constants\n   - Optional config to override colors, font size\n2. Create src/ui/Overlay.ts with:\n   - createOverlayBackground(scene, options?): { blocker, box, objects[] }\n   - Creates full-screen input-blocking rectangle and optional visible overlay box\n   - Configurable: depth, box dimensions, box alpha, box color\n   - dismissOverlay(objects): void -- destroys all overlay game objects\n3. Create src/ui/MenuButton.ts with:\n   - createMenuButton(scene, x, y, depth?): Phaser.GameObjects.Text\n   - Pre-configured [ Menu ] button that navigates to GameSelectorScene\n4.

Games built on the engine feel flat and unresponsive without auditory feedback. A reusable sound system is needed in the core engine so that any example game can add audio cues without reimplementing sound infrastructure.\n\n## Users\n\n- **Player:** Wants responsive audio feedback during gameplay to reinforce actions and understand game state.\n  - *\"As a player, I want to hear distinct sounds when I draw, flip, swap, and discard cards so that the game feels polished and I get immediate feedback on my actions.\"*\n  - *\"As a player, I want to control sound volume and mute audio from an in-game settings panel so I can adjust the experience to my preference.\"*\n\n- **Engine developer:** Wants a reusable sound module that integrates with the existing event system and follows the project's Phaser-agnostic patterns.\n  - *\"As an engine developer, I want a SoundManager in the core engine that subscribes to GameEventEmitter events and auto-plays mapped sounds so that adding audio to a new game is a configuration step, not a re-implementation.\"*\n  - *\"As an engine developer, I want card-level events (card-drawn, card-flipped, card-swapped, card-discarded) added to GameEventEmitter so that any system -- audio, analytics, replay -- can react to granular gameplay actions.\"*\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. A `SoundManager` class exists in `src/core-engine/`, exported from the barrel file, following the Phaser-agnostic interface pattern (like `PhaserEventBridge`). It provides: register sound by key, play by key, stop, mute/unmute toggle, and volume control (0.0--1.0).\n2. `GameEventEmitter` is extended with 5 new events: `card-drawn`, `card-flipped`, `card-swapped`, `card-discarded`, and `ui-interaction`, with typed payloads. Existing events and consumers are unaffected.\n3. `SoundManager` can subscribe to `GameEventEmitter` events via a declarative event-to-sound mapping configuration, automatically playing the mapped sound when the event fires.\n4. The Golf game emits the new card-level events at the appropriate moments and loads/plays at least 8 distinct SFX: card-draw, card-flip, card-swap, card-discard, turn-change, round-end, score-reveal, and ui-click.\n5. Mute preference persists across page reloads via localStorage.\n6. All audio assets are .mp3 format, CC0 or permissively licensed, stored under `public/assets/audio/`, and attributed in `public/assets/CREDITS.md`.\n7. Unit tests cover SoundManager core logic (registration, play-by-key, mute/unmute, volume, event-to-sound mapping). `npm test` passes and `npm run build` succeeds.\n8. A settings panel with mute toggle and volume slider is delivered as a separate child work item with its own acceptance criteria.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **Phaser-agnostic interface:** SoundManager must follow the same dependency-injection pattern as `PhaserEventBridge` -- define a minimal `SoundPlayer` interface (play, stop, volume, mute), inject Phaser's sound manager at runtime. No compile-time Phaser imports in `src/core-engine/`.\n- **Browser autoplay policy:** Audio playback requires user interaction before the Web Audio API context is unlocked. The implementation must handle this gracefully (Phaser 3 handles this internally, but it should be verified).\n- **Licensing:** All audio assets must be CC0, MIT, Apache 2.0, or similarly permissive per project policy.\n- **SFX only:** Background music is out of scope. The SoundManager API should not preclude adding it later, but no looping/music features are required.\n- **File format:** .mp3 only. No need for .ogg fallbacks.\n- **Backward compatibility:** The 5 new GameEventEmitter events must be additive. Existing event consumers and tests must not break.\n\n## Existing State\n\n- **Core engine** (`src/core-engine/`): 7 modules including GameEventEmitter (5 lifecycle events), PhaserEventBridge, TurnSequencer, UndoRedoManager, TranscriptStore. All Phaser-agnostic except the bridge's injected dependency.\n- **GameEventEmitter events:** `turn-started`, `turn-completed`, `animation-complete`, `state-settled`, `game-ended`. No card-level or UI-interaction events.\n- **Golf game** (`example-games/golf/`): Fully playable 9-Card Golf (human vs. AI) with ~10 natural SFX trigger points in `GolfScene.ts` (draw, flip, swap, discard, AI turn, round end, etc.). Currently silent.\n- **UI module** (`src/ui/`): 10 reusable components including HelpPanel (slide-out overlay), HelpButton, OverlayButton, MenuButton. No settings panel exists.\n- **Audio assets:** None. No `public/assets/audio/` directory. No audio configuration in Phaser game config.\n\n## Desired Change\n\n### Core Engine (`src/core-engine/`)\n- New `SoundManager.ts` module with Phaser-agnostic interface:\n  - `SoundPlayer` interface (minimal: `play(key)`, `stop(key)`, `setVolume(v)`, `setMute(m)`)\n  - `SoundManager` class: register sounds, play by key, mute/unmute, volume control, event-to-sound mapping via `GameEventEmitter` subscription\n  - Mute/volume persistence via localStorage\n  - Exported from `src/core-engine/index.ts`\n- Extend `GameEventEmitter` with 5 new typed events:\n  - `card-drawn` (source: stock/discard, playerIndex)\n  - `card-flipped` (position, playerIndex)\n  - `card-swapped` (position, drawnFrom, playerIndex)\n  - `card-discarded` (playerIndex)\n  - `ui-interaction` (elementId, action)\n\n### Golf Game (`example-games/golf/`)\n- Emit new card-level events from `GolfScene.ts` at appropriate action points\n- Load 8+ SFX assets in scene preload\n- Configure event-to-sound mapping via SoundManager\n- Wire SoundManager into the Phaser scene lifecycle (init with scene's sound manager, cleanup on shutdown)\n\n### Audio Assets\n- Source 8+ CC0 .mp3 sound effects and store in `public/assets/audio/`\n- Update `public/assets/CREDITS.md` with attribution\n\n### Settings Panel (child work item)\n- A reusable engine-level settings panel (slide-out, modelled after HelpPanel) with mute toggle and volume slider. This will be tracked as a separate child work item under this one, with sections for engine-wide settings (sound) and placeholder structure for future game-specific settings.\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n### Risks\n- **Browser autoplay:** Web Audio context may be locked until user interaction. Phaser 3 internally handles context unlocking, but this must be verified on mobile browsers. Mitigation: test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari mobile.\n- **CC0 SFX quality:** Finding 8+ consistent-quality CC0 card game sound effects may require effort. Mitigation: Kenney.nl asset packs and freesound.org have large CC0 collections suitable for card games.\n- **Event backward compatibility:** Adding 5 new events to GameEventEmitter could affect existing consumers if event names collide. Mitigation: use namespaced, descriptive event names; verify no existing code listens for these names.\n- **PhaserEventBridge scope:** The existing PhaserEventBridge forwards only the current 5 lifecycle events. Adding 5 new events will require updating the bridge to forward them too, or the SoundManager must subscribe directly to the engine emitter (not via Phaser scene events). Mitigation: decide during implementation which approach is cleaner.\n- **Audio asset file size:** Multiple .mp3 files increase initial page load. Mitigation: keep SFX short (< 2s, < 50KB each); consider lazy-loading or Phaser's audio sprite support if bundle size becomes an issue.\n\n### Assumptions\n- Phaser 3.90.0's `WebAudioSoundManager` is sufficient; no additional audio libraries are needed.\n- Short .mp3 sound effects (< 2 seconds each) are adequate for all required SFX.\n- The existing `GameEventEmitter` architecture supports adding new events without breaking changes (it's a typed map, so new keys are additive).\n- The settings panel child work item can be developed and merged independently of the core SoundManager work.\n- The SoundManager subscribes to the engine-side `GameEventEmitter` directly, not through the PhaserEventBridge, keeping audio triggering Phaser-agnostic.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **9-Card Golf** (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB) [completed]: Parent epic; this sound work was discovered during its implementation.\n- **Core Engine Event System** (CG-0MLTFSAOM1W4UKI8) [completed]: Established GameEventEmitter; this work item extends it with card-level events.\n- **Golf Scene Event Integration** (CG-0MLTFSPNA1WUN7MS) [completed]: Wired lifecycle events into Golf scene; this work item adds card-level event emission.\n- **Refactor common components from games into game engine** (CG-0MLTSPOK705155TZ) [completed]: Established patterns for extracting reusable components to `src/ui/`; the settings panel follows this pattern.\n- **HelpPanel Core Component** (CG-0MLTANMZ80E1GY0X) [completed]: The settings panel design is modelled after HelpPanel's slide-out UX.\n- `src/core-engine/PhaserEventBridge.ts`: Design pattern (Phaser-agnostic interface + runtime injection) that SoundManager should follow.\n- `src/core-engine/GameEventEmitter.ts`: Primary integration point; will be extended with 5 new events.\n- `example-games/golf/scenes/GolfScene.ts`: Primary SFX integration target (~10 trigger points).\n\n## Suggested Next Step\n\nBreak CG-0MLUDH5JH05H3D9J into child tasks: (1) Extend GameEventEmitter with new card-level events, (2) Implement SoundManager module, (3) Source CC0 audio assets, (4) Integrate SFX into Golf game, (5) Build settings panel (child work item). Then proceed to planning and implementation per `wl next`.\n\n## Related work (automated report)\n\nSearched Worklog (keywords: sound, audio, sfx, SoundManager, GameEventEmitter, event, PhaserEventBridge, HelpPanel, settings, volume, mute, card-drawn, card-flipped, golf) and repository files for items related to CG-0MLUDH5JH05H3D9J.\n\n### Worklog items\n\n- **Golf animation is confusing (CG-0MLTW1ZU40CQ7387)** [completed]: This item's risks section explicitly identified \"sound\" as a potential follow-on feature discovered during animation improvements. The SoundManager work was anticipated as scope expansion from this animation polish effort, confirming the lineage between animation and audio feedback improvements.\n\n- **Undo/Redo Module (CG-0MLTFC94Z00K32ZI)** [completed]: Established the command pattern and `UndoRedoManager` in `src/core-engine/`. The SoundManager follows the same Phaser-agnostic module pattern for `src/core-engine/` and must be exported from the same barrel file. The UndoRedoManager's architecture (engine module with no Phaser compile-time dependency) is the direct precedent for SoundManager's design.\n\n- **Extract game overlay and button system to src/ui/ (CG-0MLU874O10DAKCZZ)** [completed]: Extracted `Overlay`, `OverlayButton`, and `MenuButton` into reusable `src/ui/` components. The settings panel child work item will consume these same UI primitives (overlay background, styled buttons) and follow the same extraction pattern.\n\n- **Game Log Visual Replay Dev Tool (CG-0MLSN2YWY1EL17FN)** [in-progress]: The replay tool subscribes to `GameEventEmitter` lifecycle events for screenshot synchronization. The 5 new card-level events added by this work item could enable finer-grained replay capture (per-card-action screenshots). The replay tool's `PhaserEventBridge` integration also validates the bridge-forwarding pattern that SoundManager's event subscription will parallel.\n\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** [completed]: Second completed game spike. Once SoundManager is implemented and proven in Golf, Beleaguered Castle would be the natural second consumer for audio integration, validating the reusability of the SoundManager's event-to-sound mapping across different game types.\n\n- **In-Game Transcript Export Button (CG-0MLTFRU211Y0Z2WU)** [open]: Adds a UI button to the end-of-round overlay. The settings panel child work item will use the same UI component patterns (overlay buttons, scene integration). Both items extend the in-game UI surface and may share layout considerations.\n\n### Repository files\n\n- **`src/core-engine/GameEventEmitter.ts`**: Contains the typed `GameEventMap` interface (currently 5 lifecycle events) and `GameEventEmitter` class. This file must be extended with 5 new card-level event types (`card-drawn`, `card-flipped`, `card-swapped`, `card-discarded`, `ui-interaction`) and their typed payloads. The existing typed map pattern (lines 86-92) makes additive extension straightforward.\n\n- **`src/core-engine/PhaserEventBridge.ts`**: Defines the `PhaserLikeEventEmitter` interface and `PhaserEventBridge` class. The SoundManager must follow this same Phaser-agnostic dependency-injection pattern: define a minimal `SoundPlayer` interface, accept a concrete implementation at runtime. The bridge also forwards events between engine and Phaser — the new card-level events may need forwarding decisions.\n\n- **`src/core-engine/index.ts`**: Barrel file exporting all core-engine public API (8 modules currently). SoundManager and the new event types must be added to this barrel file.\n\n- **`src/ui/HelpPanel.ts`**: The slide-out help panel implementation. The settings panel child work item is explicitly modelled after HelpPanel's architecture (panel container, slide animation, close button, content sections). Understanding HelpPanel's API (`HelpPanelConfig`, `HelpSection`) is essential for designing the settings panel.\n\n- **`src/ui/index.ts`**: UI module barrel file exporting 10 components. The settings panel, once built, must be added here following the same export pattern.\n\n- **`example-games/golf/scenes/GolfScene.ts`**: The primary SFX integration target. Contains ~10 natural trigger points for audio (draw, flip, swap, discard, AI turn, round-end, game-over).

{"data":{"assignee":"opencode","createdAt":"2026-02-20T08:05:02.585Z","createdBy":"","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","dependencies":[],"description":"# Intake Brief: Add Medieval-Themed Sound Effects to Beleaguered Castle\n\n**Priority: Medium** | **Type: Feature (Epic)** | **Assignee: TBD**\n\n> Add a full set of medieval/castle-themed sound effects to the Beleaguered Castle solitaire game using the existing Sound Engine infrastructure (GameEventEmitter, SoundManager, PhaserEventBridge, SettingsPanel), with new Tone.js-generated audio assets and new solitaire-specific event types.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe Beleaguered Castle game is fully playable but completely silent. The Golf game already has sound effects integrated via the Sound Engine (SoundManager, GameEventEmitter, PhaserEventBridge), a SettingsPanel with mute/volume controls, and 8 procedurally generated WAV files. However, Beleaguered Castle has zero audio integration -- no event emitter, no sound manager, no audio preloading, and no settings panel. Adding themed sound effects will significantly improve the player experience, provide feedback for card interactions, and validate that the Sound Engine is reusable across multiple games.\n\n## Users\n\n- **Player (primary):** Wants audible feedback when interacting with cards -- picking up, placing, invalid moves, winning, losing -- to make the game feel more polished and responsive.\n  - *\"As a player, I want to hear satisfying medieval-themed sounds when I move cards, complete foundations, and win or lose, so the game feels immersive and gives me clear audio feedback on my actions.\"*\n\n- **Engine developer:** Wants to validate that the Sound Engine (SoundManager, GameEventEmitter, SettingsPanel) is truly reusable across games without significant modification.\n  - *\"As an engine developer, I want to integrate the Sound Engine into a second game to confirm the architecture is game-agnostic and identify any missing abstractions.\"*\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. **All 12-15 sound trigger points have audio:** Card pickup, foundation drop, tableau drop, snap-back (invalid move), deal animation, win fanfare, loss sound, auto-complete cascade start, auto-complete card landing, undo, redo, card selection (click-to-move), deselection, and UI button clicks all produce distinct sound effects.\n2. **Medieval/castle theme:** All sounds have a medieval/castle aesthetic -- deeper stone-like thuds for card placement, metallic chimes for foundation completions, brass-like fanfare for wins, heavy gate-closing for losses, etc. Sounds are clearly distinct from the Golf game's set.\n3. **Tone.js synthesis:** All new audio assets are generated procedurally using Tone.js in a one-off Node.js script (not the existing `generate-sfx.mjs`). Output is WAV files saved to `public/assets/audio/beleaguered-castle/` (or a sub-directory structure). All generated sounds are CC0/public domain since they are synthesized from scratch.\n4. **Event-driven architecture:** Sounds are triggered via GameEventEmitter events, not direct `soundManager.play()` calls. The BeleagueredCastleScene emits events at all action points, and an EventSoundMapping configuration binds events to sounds.\n5. **New solitaire event types:** GameEventEmitter is extended with new event types for solitaire-specific mechanics: `card-to-foundation`, `card-to-tableau`, `card-pickup`, `card-snap-back`, `auto-complete-start`, `auto-complete-card`, `undo`, `redo`, `card-selected`, `card-deselected`, and `deal-card`. These are added to the shared `GameEventMap` so other solitaire games can reuse them.\n6. **SettingsPanel integrated:** The existing SettingsPanel (mute toggle + volume slider) is added to the Beleaguered Castle scene, providing consistent audio controls matching the Golf game.\n7. **All tests pass:** `npm test` passes, `npm run build` succeeds. New unit tests cover the new event types and sound mapping configuration.\n8. **Asset attribution:** `public/assets/CREDITS.md` updated with attribution for the new Tone.js-generated sounds (CC0, synthesized procedurally).\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **Tone.js as a one-off script dependency:** Tone.js must be added as a devDependency (`npm install --save-dev tone`). It is used only in a generation script, not bundled into the game runtime. The game loads pre-generated WAV files at runtime, identical to the existing Golf pattern.\n- **No changes to existing Golf sounds:** The Golf game's existing 8 WAV files and sound integration must remain unchanged and functional.\n- **Reuse existing Sound Engine:** The SoundManager, PhaserEventBridge, and SettingsPanel must be used as-is. If modifications are needed, they must be backward-compatible with the Golf game's integration.\n- **Shared GameEventEmitter:** New event types are added to the shared `GameEventMap` in `src/core-engine/GameEventEmitter.ts`, not in a game-specific emitter. This ensures reusability for future solitaire games.\n- **Licensing:** All generated sounds must be CC0/public domain (guaranteed by procedural synthesis). Tone.js itself is MIT-licensed.\n- **Quality gates:** `npm test` and `npm run build` must pass before any merge.\n\n## Existing State\n\n- **Sound Engine (complete, proven in Golf):**\n  - `src/core-engine/SoundManager.ts` -- Phaser-agnostic SoundManager with DI (`SoundPlayer` interface), `EventSoundMapping` type, localStorage persistence for mute/volume\n  - `src/core-engine/GameEventEmitter.ts` -- 10 event types (5 lifecycle + 5 card-level: `card-drawn`, `card-flipped`, `card-swapped`, `card-discarded`, `ui-interaction`)\n  - `src/core-engine/PhaserEventBridge.ts` -- Bidirectional bridge between GameEventEmitter and Phaser.Events\n  - `src/ui/SettingsPanel.ts` -- Mute toggle + volume slider, tested (11 tests)\n  - `src/ui/SettingsButton.ts` -- Gear icon button\n  - 8 WAV files in `public/assets/audio/` (card-draw, card-flip, card-swap, card-discard, turn-change, round-end, score-reveal, ui-click)\n  - `scripts/generate-sfx.mjs` -- Existing procedural WAV generator (uses audiobuffer-to-wav, Node.js only)\n\n- **Beleaguered Castle (complete, no audio):**\n  - `example-games/beleaguered-castle/scenes/BeleagueredCastleScene.ts` -- 1488-line main scene with drag-and-drop, click-to-move, auto-complete, undo/redo, win/loss overlays, help panel\n  - `example-games/beleaguered-castle/createBeleagueredCastleGame.ts` -- Phaser game config (needs `audio: { disableWebAudio: false }`)\n  - `example-games/beleaguered-castle/BeleagueredCastleRules.ts` -- Pure game logic\n  - Key interaction points identified for SFX triggers (see Desired Change below)\n\n- **Golf game (reference implementation):**\n  - Pattern: define `SFX_KEYS` constants -> preload audio -> create `SoundPlayer` wrapper -> create `SoundManager` -> register SFX -> declare `EventSoundMapping` -> emit events at action points -> create `SettingsPanel` -> cleanup on shutdown\n\n## Desired Change\n\n### 1. Extend GameEventEmitter with solitaire events\nAdd new event types to `src/core-engine/GameEventEmitter.ts`:\n- `card-to-foundation` -- card placed on a foundation pile (with suit, rank payload)\n- `card-to-tableau` -- card placed on a tableau column\n- `card-pickup` -- card picked up (drag start or click-to-move selection)\n- `card-snap-back` -- invalid move, card returns to original position\n- `auto-complete-start` -- auto-complete cascade begins\n- `auto-complete-card` -- individual card auto-completed to foundation\n- `undo` -- undo action performed\n- `redo` -- redo action performed\n- `card-selected` -- card selected via click-to-move\n- `card-deselected` -- card deselected (click elsewhere or different card)\n- `deal-card` -- card dealt during initial deal animation\n\nAdd corresponding payload interfaces. Unit tests for the new event types.\n\n### 2. Generate medieval-themed Tone.js sound effects\nCreate a new script (e.g., `scripts/generate-castle-sfx.ts` or `.mjs`) using Tone.js to procedurally synthesize ~12-15 WAV files:\n- **card-pickup:** Stone scrape / heavy lift (short, textured noise burst with low resonance)\n- **card-to-foundation:** Metallic bell chime (bright, ascending, celebratory)\n- **card-to-tableau:** Stone thud / heavy placement (deep, short, satisfying)\n- **card-snap-back:** Wooden clunk / rejection (dull, low, short -- \"nope\")\n- **deal-card:** Quick stone slide / parchment shuffle (repeated during deal stagger)\n- **win-fanfare:** Triumphant brass-like ascending fanfare (3-5 notes, majestic)\n- **loss-sound:** Deep descending tone / heavy gate closing (somber)\n- **auto-complete-start:** Ascending sparkle / magic activation\n- **auto-complete-card:** Quick bright chime (plays rapidly during cascade, so must be very short; consider slight pitch variation per card for a musical cascade effect)\n- **undo:** Reverse swoosh / rewind sound\n- **redo:** Forward swoosh (opposite of undo)\n- **card-select:** Soft metallic click / highlight\n- **card-deselect:** Softer inverse of select\n- **ui-click:** Castle-themed button press (stone or iron)\n\nOutput to `public/assets/audio/beleaguered-castle/` (separate from Golf's sounds).\n\n### 3. Integrate SFX into BeleagueredCastleScene\nFollowing the Golf pattern:\n- Add audio preloading in `preload()`\n- Create `SoundPlayer` wrapper and `SoundManager` instance in `create()`\n- Create `GameEventEmitter` and `PhaserEventBridge`\n- Define `EventSoundMapping` binding events to sound keys\n- Emit events at all identified action points throughout the scene\n- Add `SettingsPanel` and `SettingsButton` to the scene\n- Update `createBeleagueredCastleGame.ts` Phaser config with `audio: { disableWebAudio: false }`\n- Clean up sound resources on scene shutdown\n\n### 4. Update asset attribution\nUpdate `public/assets/CREDITS.md` with attribution for the new medieval-themed sounds (CC0, procedurally synthesized with Tone.js).\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n### Risks\n- **Tone.js synthesis quality:** Procedural synthesis with Tone.js may not produce sounds that feel \"medieval\" enough without significant tuning. Mitigation: iterate on synthesis parameters; the script can be re-run easily to regenerate sounds.\n- **GameEventEmitter expansion:** Adding ~11 new event types to the shared emitter increases the API surface. Mitigation: choose general names (e.g., `card-to-foundation` not `beleaguered-castle-foundation-drop`) that other solitaire games can reuse.\n- **Auto-complete sound spam:** The auto-complete cascade can move many cards rapidly. If `auto-complete-card` sounds overlap excessively it may sound unpleasant. Mitigation: use very short sounds; consider limiting concurrent playback or adding a small pitch variation per card for a musical cascade effect.\n- **Scene file size:** BeleagueredCastleScene.ts is already 1488 lines. Adding sound integration will increase it further. Mitigation: keep sound setup modular (constants at top, mapping object separate from logic).\n\n### Assumptions\n- Tone.js can run in Node.js for offline WAV generation (it supports offline rendering via `Tone.Offline()`).\n- The SoundManager, PhaserEventBridge, and SettingsPanel are reusable without modification for a second game.\n- The existing `SoundPlayer` interface is sufficient for Beleaguered Castle's needs (no new methods required).\n- Players expect sounds on all interactive elements; no subset of actions should be silent.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **Sound Engine & Golf Game Audio (CG-0MLUDH5JH05H3D9J)** [completed]: Built the SoundManager, GameEventEmitter card-level events, PhaserEventBridge, SettingsPanel, 8 WAV SFX, and Golf integration. This work item extends that infrastructure to a second game.\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** [completed]: The game this feature targets. All gameplay mechanics (drag-and-drop, click-to-move, auto-complete, undo/redo, win/loss) are fully implemented.\n- **SFX generation tool using Tone.js (CG-0MLUJQTSV1CA9APQ)** [open]: Backlog item for a reusable Tone.js SFX generation tool as a separate project. This work item uses Tone.js directly in a one-off script; the reusable tool remains a separate concern.\n- **Extend GameEventEmitter with card-level events (CG-0MLUGZPSA0PXNV1N)** [completed]: Added the first 5 card-level events. This work item adds ~11 more solitaire-specific events following the same pattern.\n\n## Suggested Next Step\n\nCreate the worklog work item, then break into child items: (1) Extend GameEventEmitter with solitaire events, (2) Generate medieval-themed Tone.js sounds, (3) Integrate SFX into BeleagueredCastleScene, (4) Update asset attribution. Begin with the event emitter extension since it unblocks the integration work.","effort":"","id":"CG-0MLULU5141WLVC2U","issueType":"epic","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":null,"priority":"medium","risk":"","sortIndex":2500,"stage":"in_progress","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Add Medieval-Themed Sound Effects to Beleaguered Castle","updatedAt":"2026-02-20T08:46:12.590Z"},"type":"workitem"}

{"data":{"author":"opencode","comment":"Fix implemented and merged to main.\n\n**Root cause (Beleaguered Castle):** Overlay buttons were placed inside a Phaser Container. Phaser's sortGameObjects uses camera.renderList for input priority, but Container children are never added to renderList (only the Container itself is). This caused buttons to always sort below card sprites during hit-test sorting, making them unresponsive.\n\n**Root cause (Golf):** Overlay buttons were standalone objects at depth 11, but no interactive input blocker existed to prevent card sprites (depth 0) from intercepting clicks. Without an interactive blocker, Phaser's input system allowed lower-depth card sprites to receive pointer events instead of the overlay buttons.\n\n**Fix (Beleaguered Castle):** Replaced Container-based overlay with scene-level objects tracked in an array. Background rectangle made interactive at depth 2000 to block input. Buttons placed at depth 2001.\n\n**Fix (Golf):** Added a full-screen nearly-invisible interactive rectangle at depth 10 behind the end-screen overlay to block input on objects behind it.\n\n**Files changed:**\n- example-games/beleaguered-castle/scenes/BeleagueredCastleScene.ts\n- example-games/golf/scenes/GolfScene.ts\n\n**Verification:** All 342 unit tests pass, TypeScript compiles cleanly, production build succeeds.\n\nCommit: 82ae451, Merge: 4e3b8ce","createdAt":"2026-02-19T19:56:59.835Z","id":"CG-C0MLTVTV7E0NHFW84","references":[],"workItemId":"CG-0MLTSYKYU11LEUWX"},"type":"comment"}
