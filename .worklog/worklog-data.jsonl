{"data":{"assignee":"Map","createdAt":"2026-02-18T18:47:10.416Z","createdBy":"","deleteReason":"","deletedBy":"","dependencies":[{"from":"CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB","to":"CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH"}],"description":"# Intake Brief: 9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)\n\n**Priority: Critical** | **Type: Feature (Epic)** | **Assignee: Map**\n\n> First engine spike: build a playable single-round 9-Card Golf game (human vs. AI) to validate the Tableau Card Engine architecture end-to-end and surface missing abstractions before tackling larger games.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe Tableau Card Engine has a working scaffold (toolchain, project structure, Phaser integration) but zero game logic, card abstractions, or gameplay features. A small, well-scoped spike is needed to validate the engine architecture end-to-end — from card data models through game rules to a playable Phaser UI — and to surface missing framework capabilities before tackling larger games. 9-Card Golf's tiny rule set (flip, swap, discard on a 3x3 grid) makes it the ideal first spike.\n\n## Users\n\n- **Engine developer (primary):** Validates that the engine's modular architecture (card-system, rule-engine, core-engine, ui) can support a real game. Uses the spike to discover which abstractions are missing and which APIs need refinement.\n  - *\"As an engine developer, I want to build a complete card game using the engine modules so I can identify gaps in Card, Deck, Pile, and Grid abstractions before building more complex games.\"*\n\n- **QA / AI tester:** Uses an AI player to exercise all game paths (random + greedy strategies) and produce reproducible game transcripts for regression testing.\n  - *\"As a tester, I want an AI opponent that can play complete games automatically so I can validate scoring, turn flow, and edge cases without manual play.\"*\n\n- **Game designer (future):** Uses the completed spike as a reference implementation and template for building additional example games.\n  - *\"As a game designer, I want a working reference game that demonstrates how to wire up scenes, rules, and UI so I can quickly scaffold new card games.\"*\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. **Playable single round:** A human player can play a complete single round of 9-Card Golf against 1 AI opponent in a Phaser scene — including initial card reveal, draw/swap/discard turns, and end-of-round scoring.\n2. **AI player with two strategies:** An AI player is implemented with both random (valid moves) and greedy (minimize visible score) strategies, selectable at game start or via configuration.\n3. **Correct scoring:** Scoring logic correctly implements: A=1, 2=-2, 3-10=face value, J/Q=10, K=0, three-of-a-kind columns=0. Automated unit tests cover at least 3 distinct scoring scenarios (including a column-of-three-of-a-kind case).\n4. **Game transcript:** Each completed game produces a JSON transcript recording the full sequence of turns, actions, and resulting board states — sufficient to replay and verify the game.\n5. **Visual replay (stretch goal):** A visual replay capability captures a screenshot or canvas snapshot per turn for human review of completed games. This is a stretch goal for this spike — a dedicated dev tool for game log playback and screenshot capture will be tracked separately.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **First spike — no existing game logic:** All four engine modules (card-system, core-engine, rule-engine, ui) are currently empty stubs (version constants only). Every game-related abstraction must be built from scratch during this spike.\n- **Card assets incomplete:** Only 2 placeholder SVGs exist (ace_of_spades.svg, card_back.svg at 140x190px). A full 52-card deck of face assets is needed. Assets must be CC0 or permissively licensed (MIT, Apache 2.0, or similar) per project policy.\n- **No assumptions about framework features:** This is the project's first game spike. Do not assume any framework features exist beyond the proven scaffold (Vite, TypeScript, Phaser, Vitest). Missing capabilities must be built or sourced as part of the spike.\n- **Single round only:** Scope is limited to one round of play (one deal through to scoring). Multi-round / \"9 holes\" format is out of scope.\n- **1 Human + 1 AI:** Player count is fixed at one human and one AI opponent for this spike.\n- **Licensing:** All assets and code must be open and freely available for commercial use per CREDITS.md policy.\n\n## Existing State\n\n- **Toolchain:** Fully operational — Vite 6.1, TypeScript 5.7 (strict mode), Vitest 3.0, Phaser 3.90.0. Dev server on port 3000, production builds to `dist/`.\n- **Project structure:** Monorepo layout with `src/` (engine modules) and `example-games/` (game spikes). Path aliases configured (`@core-engine/*`, `@card-system/*`, `@rule-engine/*`, `@ui/*`).\n- **Engine modules:** All four modules (`card-system`, `core-engine`, `rule-engine`, `ui`) exist as directories with barrel `index.ts` files exporting only version constants. Zero implementation.\n- **Hello-world example:** Working Phaser scene proving SVG asset loading, tween animations, and text rendering. No interactivity or game logic. Establishes card dimensions (140x190px) and scene patterns.\n- **Assets:** 2 SVGs (ace of spades face, card back) at 140x190px in `public/assets/cards/`. Attribution in `CREDITS.md`.\n- **Tests:** Single smoke test confirming Vitest works. No meaningful game or engine tests.\n\n## Desired Change\n\nBuild a playable 9-Card Golf example game at `example-games/golf/` that exercises and populates the engine modules:\n\n- **card-system:** Implement Card type (rank, suit, faceUp), Deck (create, shuffle, draw), and Pile (push, pop, peek) abstractions. Add a Grid[3][3] type (may live locally in the golf game initially).\n- **rule-engine:** Implement Golf-specific turn logic (draw from pile or discard, replace grid card or discard drawn card), end-of-round detection (all cards face-up), and scoring rules.\n- **core-engine:** Implement minimal game state management and turn sequencing sufficient to drive a 2-player (human + AI) game loop.\n- **ui:** Build Phaser scene(s) for the golf game: 3x3 grid layout, draw/discard piles, card flip/swap animations, score display, turn indicators.\n- **AI player:** Implement two strategies (random valid move, greedy minimize-score) behind a selectable interface.\n- **Recording:** Produce a JSON game transcript per completed game. Per-turn visual snapshots are a stretch goal (see Risks & Assumptions).\n- **Card assets:** Source or generate a complete 52-card deck of face SVGs (CC0/permissive) at 140x190px. Update `public/assets/CREDITS.md` with attribution.\n- **Tests:** Unit tests for scoring logic (minimum 3 scenarios), turn legality, and deck operations. All tests must pass via `npm test`; build must succeed via `npm run build`.\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n### Risks\n- **Scope creep from engine extraction:** Building reusable engine modules alongside a game spike may slow progress. Mitigation: build game-specific implementations first, then extract to shared modules only where the abstraction is clear and stable.\n- **Card asset sourcing:** Finding or generating 52 CC0/permissive SVG card faces at consistent quality and dimensions (140x190px) may take non-trivial effort. Mitigation: consider programmatic SVG generation or an existing open-source deck (e.g., the SVG-cards GitHub repo).\n- **Visual replay deferred:** Per-turn screenshot capture is a stretch goal for this spike. A dedicated dev tool for game log playback and image capture (using Playwright or similar) will be built as a separate high-priority work item, blocked by this spike. See related work item below.\n- **Grid abstraction placement:** Unclear whether Grid[3][3] should live in card-system (reusable) or locally in the golf game. Mitigation: build locally first; extract after a second game validates the abstraction.\n\n### Assumptions\n- A standard 52-card deck (no jokers) is sufficient for 9-Card Golf.\n- The 9-card variant uses the scoring rules from Wikipedia (A=1, 2=-2, 3-10=face, J/Q=10, K=0, column-of-three=0). No house-rule variants are in scope.\n- Phaser 3.90.0's built-in scene management and tween system are sufficient for card flip/swap animations without additional libraries.\n- The AI player does not need to be competitive — it only needs to make legal moves to exercise game paths.\n\n## Suggested Next Step\n\nBreak CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB into child work items covering: card asset sourcing, card-system implementation, rule-engine (Golf scoring + turn logic), core-engine (game loop + state), UI (Phaser scenes), AI player, game recording, and test suite. Then begin implementation of the first child item per `wl next`.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **Game Log Visual Replay Dev Tool (CG-0MLSN2YWY1EL17FN):** High-priority feature to build a Playwright-based dev tool that replays JSON game transcripts and captures per-turn screenshots. Blocked by this spike (requires working game with transcript output).\n- **Scaffold Card Game Engine project (CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH):** Completed epic that set up the repository structure, toolchain, and empty module stubs. This spike builds directly on that foundation.\n- **Wikipedia — Golf (card game):** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_(card_game) — Canonical rules reference.\n- **BoardGameGeek — Golf:** https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Golf — Variant rules and community discussion.\n- **AGENTS.md:** Project rules, spike-driven development approach, engine architecture, and quality gates.\n- **docs/DEVELOPER.md:** Developer setup, build/test commands, and asset management.\n- **public/assets/CREDITS.md:** Asset attribution policy and suggested sources (OpenGameArt.org, Kenney.nl, SVG-cards repo).\n\n## Related work (automated report)\n\nSearched Worklog (keywords: golf, card, game, spike, scoring, grid, deck, phaser) and repository files. No duplicate work items found.\n\n### Worklog items\n\n- **Scaffold Card Game Engine project (CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH)** [completed]: Established the repository structure, Vite/TypeScript/Phaser toolchain, hello-world example, and empty engine module stubs. This spike is a direct dependency — it provides the foundation (build tooling, directory layout, card asset pipeline patterns) that the Golf spike will build on. The hello-world scene patterns (SVG loading at 140x190px, Phaser.Scene subclass, game config) serve as templates for the Golf scene implementation.\n\n- **Game Log Visual Replay Dev Tool (CG-0MLSN2YWY1EL17FN)** [blocked by this item]: High-priority feature to build a Playwright-based CLI tool that replays JSON game transcripts and captures per-turn screenshots. Directly blocked by this spike — it requires a working game producing JSON transcripts. The transcript format defined by this Golf spike will become the initial schema for the replay tool.\n\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** [blocked by this item]: Open solitaire spike with deterministic, all-face-up gameplay. Blocked by this spike because it will reuse Card, Deck, and Pile abstractions built here. Its tableau/foundation model will exercise different engine patterns (build-up-by-suit vs. Golf's grid/scoring), providing a second validation point for engine module APIs.\n\n- **Sushi Go! (CG-0MLSDWSCG154TUEL)**, **Splendor (CG-0MLSDX4B91DG6S1A)**, **Lost Cities (CG-0MLSDXELC06VESJL)**, **The Mind (CG-0MLSDXNMM1R2IMT9)**, **Coloretto (CG-0MLSDXY9F1FSGQ38)** [all blocked]: Five additional game spikes at idea stage. All will consume the card-system and core-engine modules first built by this Golf spike. Not directly related but will benefit from abstractions validated here.\n\n- **Add pre-commit hook to enforce doc updates (CG-0MLSHQMDY1H0I2B7)** [open]: Infrastructure task to add doc-update enforcement. Not directly related to this spike but the Golf spike should comply with the doc-update policy when making infrastructure changes.\n\n- **Rename project to Tableau Card Engine (CG-0MLSIULHH0Y6I3DV)** [completed]: Branding rename already applied. The Golf spike should use \"Tableau Card Engine\" / \"TCE\" naming consistently.\n\n### Repository files\n\n- **`example-games/hello-world/`**: Establishes the patterns this spike should follow — `main.ts` entry point, `scenes/` directory with Phaser.Scene subclass, SVG asset loading via `this.load.svg()` with explicit dimensions, game config with scale mode and parent container.\n\n- **`src/card-system/index.ts`**: Empty stub (exports only `CARD_SYSTEM_VERSION`). This spike must populate it with Card, Deck, and Pile abstractions.\n\n- **`src/core-engine/index.ts`**: Empty stub (exports only `ENGINE_VERSION`). This spike must add minimal game state management and turn sequencing.\n\n- **`src/rule-engine/index.ts`**: Empty stub (exports only `RULE_ENGINE_VERSION`). This spike must add Golf-specific turn logic and scoring.\n\n- **`src/ui/index.ts`**: Empty stub (exports only `UI_VERSION`). This spike must add Phaser scene components for the Golf game.\n\n- **`public/assets/cards/`**: Contains 2 placeholder SVGs (ace_of_spades.svg, card_back.svg) at 140x190px establishing the card asset format. This spike must source or generate the remaining 51 card faces.\n\n- **`public/assets/CREDITS.md`**: Documents asset attribution policy and suggests sources (OpenGameArt.org, Kenney.nl, SVG-cards GitHub repo). Must be updated when new card assets are added.\n\n- **`tests/smoke.test.ts`**: Trivial Vitest smoke test. This spike must add meaningful tests for scoring logic, turn legality, and deck operations alongside this existing test.","effort":"","id":"CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB","issueType":"epic","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":null,"priority":"critical","risk":"","sortIndex":300,"stage":"in_progress","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"9-Card Golf","updatedAt":"2026-02-19T04:07:54.456Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Vite is officially supported by Phaser's project scaffolder and offers faster dev builds and HMR.\n- **Vitest**: Replaces Jest as specified in AGENTS.md. Vitest integrates natively with Vite, uses the same API as Jest, and avoids ESM/CJS compatibility friction.\n- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, targeting modern browsers (ES2020+).\n- **Flat monorepo**: Single `package.json` at root. Shared engine code in `src/` subdirectories, example games in `example-games/` with their own scenes and entry points. No npm workspaces for now.\n- **Open-source licensing**: All dependencies and assets must be permissively licensed (MIT, Apache 2.0, CC0, etc.) and suitable for commercial use.\n- **AGENTS.md must be updated** to reflect the actual tech stack decisions (Phaser 3.x, Vite, Vitest, flat monorepo structure).\n\n## Existing State\n\n- The repository contains only `AGENTS.md`, `.gitignore` (minimal, Worklog-focused), and `.worklog/` data.\n- No git repository is initialized (no `.git/` directory).\n- No `package.json`, no TypeScript config, no build tooling, no source files, no tests.\n- 7 game spike work items exist in Worklog, all at \"idea\" stage, all blocked pending scaffolding.\n\n## Desired Change\n\nAfter this work item is completed, the repository will contain:\n\n- **Git repository**: Initialized with a proper `.gitignore` and initial commit.\n- **`package.json`**: With Phaser 3.x, TypeScript, Vite, and Vitest as dependencies; scripts for `dev`, `build`, `test`, and `preview`.\n- **`tsconfig.json`**: Strict TypeScript configuration targeting ES2020, with Phaser type definitions.\n- **`vite.config.ts`**: Configured for Phaser 3.x development with dev server and production build.\n- **Directory structure**:\n  ```\n  cardGameSpikes/\n  ├── src/\n  │   ├── core-engine/       # Game loop, state management, rendering helpers\n  │   ├── card-system/       # Card definitions, deck, hand, pile abstractions\n  │   ├── rule-engine/       # Rule definitions, validation, turn logic\n  │   └── ui/                # Reusable UI components (buttons, menus, overlays)\n  ├── example-games/\n  │   └── hello-world/       # Minimal Phaser scene proving toolchain works\n  │       ├── scenes/\n  │       └── main.ts\n  ├── public/                # Static assets (HTML, images, fonts)\n  ├── tests/                 # Vitest test files\n  ├── dist/                  # Production build output (gitignored)\n  ├── AGENTS.md              # Updated with actual tech stack\n  ├── package.json\n  ├── tsconfig.json\n  ├── vite.config.ts\n  └── .gitignore             # Comprehensive Node.js/TS/Vite ignores\n  ```\n- **Hello-world scene**: A minimal Phaser 3.x scene that renders on screen, proving Vite + Phaser + TypeScript integration works end-to-end.\n- **One passing Vitest test**: Demonstrating the test framework is wired up correctly.\n- **Updated AGENTS.md**: Reflecting Phaser 3.x, Vite, Vitest, and the actual directory structure.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)** - First game spike, directly unblocked by this scaffolding.\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)** - Solitaire spike, blocked.\n- **Sushi Go! (CG-0MLSDWSCG154TUEL)** - Drafting game spike, blocked.\n- **Splendor (CG-0MLSDX4B91DG6S1A)** - Engine-building game spike, blocked.\n- **Lost Cities (CG-0MLSDXELC06VESJL)** - 2-player lanes spike, blocked.\n- **The Mind (CG-0MLSDXNMM1R2IMT9)** - Open-hand variant spike, blocked.\n- **Coloretto (CG-0MLSDXY9F1FSGQ38)** - Set-building tableau spike, blocked.\n- **Official Phaser Webpack-TS template** (https://github.com/phaserjs/template-webpack-ts) - Reference for Phaser + TypeScript project structure.\n- **Phaser `create-phaser-game` CLI** - Official scaffolder supporting Vite + TypeScript templates.\n\n## Risks & Assumptions\n\n- **Risk**: Phaser 3.x may not work seamlessly with Vite out of the box (e.g., global `Phaser` variable, canvas/WebGL initialization). *Mitigation*: The official `create-phaser-game` CLI has a Vite template, so this path is well-trodden.\n- **Risk**: The flat monorepo approach may not scale if engine modules need independent versioning later. *Mitigation*: Acceptable for a spike-driven project; migration to workspaces can be done later without major refactoring.\n- **Assumption**: Phaser 3.x TypeScript definitions are up-to-date and compatible with strict mode (they are shipped in the `phaser` npm package under `types/`).\n- **Assumption**: A single Vite entry point can serve multiple example games. If not, a per-game Vite config or multi-page setup may be needed (discoverable during first game spike implementation).\n- **Assumption**: No CI/CD pipeline is needed in this scaffolding phase; local `npm test` and `npm run build` are sufficient validation.\n\n## Suggested Next Step\n\nBreak this epic into child work items for implementation: (1) git init + .gitignore, (2) package.json + Vite + TypeScript config, (3) directory structure + placeholder modules, (4) hello-world Phaser scene, (5) Vitest setup + first test, (6) AGENTS.md update. Then implement starting from work item CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH.\n\n## Related work (automated report)\n\nSearched Worklog (keyword: scaffold, setup, phaser, card game) and repository files. No duplicate or prior scaffolding work items found.\n\n- **AGENTS.md** (`/AGENTS.md`): The project charter defining the vision, directory structure, and tech stack for the Card Game Engine. This scaffolding work item directly implements the foundational setup described in AGENTS.md, with agreed deviations (Phaser 3.x instead of 4, Vite instead of Webpack, Vitest instead of Jest).\n- **9-Card Golf (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB)**: The first and highest-priority game spike. It is directly unblocked by this scaffolding and will be the first consumer of the project structure, Phaser integration, and test framework established here. Its description references `Phaser Container` which validates the need for a working Phaser setup.\n- **Beleaguered Castle (CG-0MLSDWFLT1WB6IEB)**, **Sushi Go! (CG-0MLSDWSCG154TUEL)**, **Splendor (CG-0MLSDX4B91DG6S1A)**, **Lost Cities (CG-0MLSDXELC06VESJL)**, **The Mind (CG-0MLSDXNMM1R2IMT9)**, **Coloretto (CG-0MLSDXY9F1FSGQ38)**: All 6 remaining game spikes are blocked pending scaffolding. Each references card abstractions (Card, Deck, Pile, Hand, etc.) that will live in the `src/card-system/` module created by this work.\n- **Official Phaser Webpack-TS template** (https://github.com/phaserjs/template-webpack-ts): The community reference implementation for Phaser + TypeScript project structure. While this project uses Vite instead of Webpack, the template's `src/` layout (scenes, game config, main entry point) is a useful structural reference.\n- **Phaser `create-phaser-game` CLI**: The official Phaser scaffolder supports Vite + TypeScript templates and should be consulted during implementation for best-practice Vite configuration patterns.","effort":"","id":"CG-0MLSFU7300TLFCBH","issueType":"epic","needsProducerReview":false,"parentId":null,"priority":"high","risk":"","sortIndex":1000,"stage":"in_review","status":"completed","tags":[],"title":"Scaffold Card Game Engine project","updatedAt":"2026-02-18T20:56:08.467Z"},"type":"workitem"}

Rather than coupling screenshot capture into each example game, a dedicated dev tool that works externally via browser automation (Playwright or similar) is cleaner, reusable across all example games, and avoids polluting game code with test infrastructure.\n\n## Expected Behaviour\n\n- Accepts a path to a JSON game transcript file as input.\n- Launches a headless browser pointing at the game's dev server or a static build.\n- Steps through each turn recorded in the transcript, advancing game state accordingly.\n- Captures a PNG screenshot of the Phaser canvas after each turn.\n- Outputs screenshots to a configurable directory, named by turn number (e.g. turn-001.png, turn-002.png).\n- Produces a summary report listing turns, screenshot paths, and any errors.\n\n## Suggested Implementation Approach\n\n- Use Playwright (headless Chromium) for browser automation and screenshot capture.\n- The tool should live under src/core-engine/tools/ or a new top-level tools/ directory (to be decided during planning).\n- Game must expose a mechanism for the tool to advance turns programmatically (e.g. a global function or URL parameter that feeds actions from the transcript).\n- The JSON transcript format produced by the 9-Card Golf spike (CG-0MLSDW7YM1IWH2SB) defines the initial schema.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. A CLI command or npm script can replay a JSON game transcript and produce per-turn PNG screenshots.\n2. The tool works with the 9-Card Golf example game transcript format.\n3.

This addresses the broken UI that currently has no automated test coverage.\n\n## User Story\n\nAs an engine developer, I want automated browser tests that verify the Phaser game renders correctly and responds to user interactions, so that UI regressions are caught before they reach players.\n\n## Problem\n\nThe Golf Phaser UI (GolfScene.ts) has 674 lines of rendering and interaction code with zero automated test coverage. The UI is reported broken but there is no way to detect or prevent regressions. Phaser requires a real browser (WebGL/Canvas) and cannot run in JSDOM or happy-dom.\n\n## Approach\n\n- Use Vitest 3.x browser mode with `@vitest/browser` package and Playwright provider\n- Configure test projects in vite.config.ts to run Node-based unit tests (`*.test.ts`) and browser-based tests (`*.browser.test.ts`) together via `npm test`\n- Browser tests run in headless Chromium via Playwright\n- Tests verify: canvas renders, game objects exist, basic interaction works\n- Access Phaser game instance via `window.__PHASER_GAME__` for state assertions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. `@vitest/browser` and `playwright` are installed as dev dependencies\n2. `vite.config.ts` uses `test.projects` to define both unit and browser test configurations\n3. Browser tests use `*.browser.test.ts` naming convention\n4. At least one browser test verifies the Phaser canvas renders in the game container\n5. At least one browser test verifies initial game state is visible (card sprites, UI text)\n6.
